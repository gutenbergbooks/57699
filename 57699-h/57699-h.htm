<span class="smaller">THE YOUNG CHAMPION.</span></h2>

<p>One warm summer afternoon, a half dozen boys
on their way home from the Burkville School,
stopped to rest under the trees, which afforded a
grateful shade at the side of the dusty highway.</p>

<p>No matter how tired such a lot of youngsters
may be, they are sure to be brimming over with
mischief, and on the alert for boisterous amusement.
To picture them seated quiet, thoughtful and well
behaved is to picture what was never seen. No
such an occurrence is on record or within the
memory of the “oldest inhabitant.”</p>

<p>Among the group who reclined on the grass was
little Almon Goodwin, a cripple, with a withered
leg, which compelled him to use a crutch in walking
and debarred him from the more active sports of
his playfellows. His sunny disposition, genial
nature and scholarly ability made him a favorite
with the rest, who were always glad to favor him
and to accept playful annoyances at his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
which would have been quickly resented on the
part of the other lusty youths.</p>

<p>The largest boy of the group was Buck Kennon, a
new pupil, whose folks had lately removed to the
neighborhood. He was two years older than the
eldest of the party, and in growth and appearance
seemed to be fully sixteen years of age. He was a
rough, coarse, overbearing lad, who was feared and
disliked by the rest. Three of the boys, who resisted
his tyrannous conduct, had been beaten into
submission, and every one felt that a most disagreeable
and unwelcome member had joined the school.
They would have been glad to be rid of him, but
there he was and likely to stay with all his detested
qualities.</p>

<p>The party had been lolling on the grass in the
shade for some minutes, when Buck snatched off the
hat of the crippled boy and dashed off with it.
Almon hobbled after him, but of course could not
overtake his persecutor.</p>

<p>“That isn’t fair; let me have my hat,” called
Almon, halting in his pursuit; “why don’t you
take some one else’s hat?”</p>

<p>The bully, seeing he was not pursued, now picked
up a stone, flung the hat aloft and as it turned to
descend, let fly with the stone, which was aimed so
well that it passed through the crown, leaving a
jagged hole. The owner crooked his arm and
raised it to his face. His parents were poor and he
could not help crying over the damage done to his
property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, what a baby!” called Buck, making ready
to fling the hat up again for another shot; “I
’spose your mother will give you a whipping for not
taking care of that purty head piece.”</p>

<p>Before the hat could leave the hand of the bully,
a boy dashed forward, snatched it from his grasp,
and returned it to the sobbing owner.</p>

<p>“Buck Kennon, you are a mean coward! Why
don’t you let him alone and take <em>our</em> hats?”</p>

<p>The boy who had the courage to do this was
James Decker, two years younger than the bully
and of much slighter frame. He was the best
scholar in school and liked by playmates and
teacher. Having handed the property of the
cripple to him, he turned about and confronted the
big lad, who stood a moment amazed at his daring.
The face of Buck was crimson with anger and all
saw that trouble was impending.</p>

<p>“What business is it of yours?” he demanded;
“I’ll do as I please without asking you about it. I’ll
teach you better than to interfere.”</p>

<p>He made a snatch at the young champion’s hat,
but James dodged and in a twinkling snatched off
that of his assailant. James was much more active
than his bulky pursuer, and, dashing a few rods,
suddenly stopped, flung the handsome hat in air, and
then with the accuracy of a rifle-shot hurled a stone
clean through it.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, “see how you like it yourself.”
The other boys laughed in their delight, and the
bully boiled with rage. He never had had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
tables turned so completely upon him. It was
exasperating beyond endurance. Like a mad bull,
he rushed upon young Decker, his fists clenched and
his eyes glaring. He meant to teach the audacious
youngster a lesson that he would remember all his
life.</p>

<p>James was through running away from his
enemy. He might have dodged and eluded him, or
sped down the highway and escaped him altogether,
but the bully would take his revenge upon the
cripple, for it was just like him. Besides, a fight
for the supremacy, must come sooner or later, and
it might as well come now.</p>

<p>So Decker braced himself for the shock, and,
when the big fellow was upon him, he struck him
twice quickly and with all his strength, directly in
the face. The shock, made the greater by the
momentum of his own body, sent Buck staggering
backward and almost upon his back. The blow
was a fierce one for a boy, and big as was the bully
he could not help howling with pain. He stopped,
put his hands to his face as if to assure himself that
it was still on his shoulders, while Decker, cool and
collected, with one foot thrust forward, his fists
ready, his face pale and his eyes flashing, awaited
the next onset.</p>

<p>“You are a coward!” he called; “if there was a
boy here of your size, you would run like a rabbit,
but I’m not afraid of you.”</p>

<p>The fury of the bully was greater, if possible,
than before, but he had been taught a lesson. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
now approached more warily, but with the resolve
that he would hammer this audacious champion till
he couldn’t stand.</p>

<p>“Decker, do you want me to help you?” called
Almon Goodwin, hobbling a few steps forward;
“I can give him one whack with my crutch.”</p>

<p>“No; keep out of the way and don’t bother me,”
replied James, never once removing his eyes from
his assailant; “I’m not afraid of him.”</p>

<p>Eyes glaring, nostrils snorting, Buck Kennon
began slowly circling around the lad, looking for a
chance to leap upon him unawares; but James was
alert. He turned so as to confront him all the time,
and did not intend to be surprised.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bully lunged forward. James met
him as before, but in one sense Buck was braced
against the reception which awaited him. He knew
he would be struck and the blows that landed in his
face were as severe as before, but they did not
check him. He plowed ahead, and while Decker
was trying to fight him off the latter retaliated
several times and then clinched with him.</p>

<p>Buck was stronger than his more youthful antagonist,
and despite the strenuous exertion of Decker,
he went down on his back, with the bully on top.
In a flash Decker turned him, and over and over
they went, fighting like a couple of wild cats.</p>

<p>The probabilities are that, despite the courage
and quickness of James Decker, he would have
come out second best in the furious struggle.
Could he have been able to hold his feet and prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
his foe from closing in, he would have defeated
him, but when it became a contest of brute strength
he must succumb.</p>

<p>Fortunately at this crisis, a newcomer appeared
on the scene and proceeded straightway to take a
decisive part in it. The individual was a portly,
middle-aged gentleman, Mr. Elgin Willard, the
most prominent citizen in the neighborhood. He
had lately been elected to congress, and was taking
a stroll, when he came upon the group of boys, all
of whom were so interested in the fight that they
did not notice him, until he made known his presence
in what literally was a striking manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Willard always carried his gold-headed cane
with him. It was a present from his admiring constituents
and he was very proud of it. It pleased
them, and it pleased him, to take it with him to
church, to his office and wherever he went.</p>

<p>He arrived at the moment that Buck Kennon by
sheer strength had twisted James Decker off his
breast and swung himself over upon him. Decker
held his assailant as close down as he could, so
as to prevent his doing too much execution, but
Buck was savage and was forcing matters. He was
one of those boys who grow so fast that their clothing
is always too tight for them, so he was peculiarly
exposed to the new attack that was now made in
hurricane fashion.</p>

<p>“Bless me! this is shameful!” exclaimed Mr.
Willard striding forward; “two boys fighting, and
one of them twice as big as the other! He will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
beat the life out of the little fellow! It was providential
that I arrived when I did! There!”</p>

<p>The uplifted cane whizzed through the air and
came down with a whack like the report of a fire
cracker. It landed where it was intended, and
Buck Kennon, with a yell of pain, leaped to his feet,
vigorously rubbing the wounded portion of his
body, caught up his hat and still insisting in a loud
voice that he had been killed, disappeared down the
road in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>Now that he was out of the way, the Honorable
Mr. Willard turned upon young Decker, who was
climbing to his feet and brushing his clothes.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, young man?
What do you mean by fighting that boy?”</p>

<p>“I was trying to prevent his licking me,” replied
James so demurely that the gentleman smiled in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>“You ought to know better than to attack a boy
of that size.”</p>

<p>“I guess he’ll know better than to attack me
next time; I’m not afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“Did he begin this fight?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“The coward! if I had known that I would have
caned him harder than ever,” exclaimed the congressman,
turning and looking at the yelling youngster,
who was far down the highway, as if he meditated
starting after him; “why did he attack you?”</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Willard, I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>It was Almon Goodwin who came limping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
forward. Everybody knew the cripple, and Mr.
Willard said kindly:</p>

<p>“Why, Almon, I didn’t see you before; are you
mixed up in this shameful business?”</p>

<p>“The only shameful part of it is what that big
boy did. He took off my hat and threw a stone
through it. Look what a hole he made, and it’s the
only hat I have; I cried and asked him to give it
back, but he laughed at me and was going to
throw another stone through it, when Decker there
called him a coward, served his hat the same way,
and then Buck Kennon went for him. My! didn’t
Jim let him have it! He must have loosened all
his teeth and made his nose flatter than it ever was
before. If he hadn’t got down, he would have given
him the worst licking he ever had.”</p>

<p>Mr. Willard turned toward young Decker, who
had replaced his hat, brushed his soiled garments,
and was so well over his rough usage that he smiled
at the words of little Almon Goodwin.</p>

<p>“Young man, is that so?” demanded the gentleman
in a stern voice. “Did that bully attack you
because you were defending Almon from his persecution?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” modestly replied Decker.</p>

<p>“Young man, come here, sir,” thundered the congressman.</p>

<p>James stepped forward, wondering whether he,
too, was to feel the weight of that black, shining
cane.</p>

<p>“Give me your hand, sir; I’m proud of you, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>And warmly clasping the hand of James, the
happy Mr. Willard shook it with fervor, while the
other boys looked on and felt that it was deserved.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Mr. Willard, releasing
the hand and looking down into the handsome
face of the boy.</p>

<p>“Decker.”</p>

<p>“The son of Herbert Decker?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, I must shake your hand again; your
father is one of my best and oldest friends; he did
more than any other one man to bring about my
election to congress; I suspect it was he who
started the cane presentation business to me. Is he
proud of you, James?”</p>

<p>The boy laughed outright at the overwhelming
manner of the portly congressman.</p>

<p>“I don’t think he is; at least I never heard him
say so; when he believes I need a switching, he
doesn’t forget to give it to me.”</p>

<p>“He does, eh? Well, I shall see him about that
at once. It must be stopped; I won’t allow it; I
don’t believe such a manly fellow as you ever
deserves it. How old are you?”</p>

<p>“Thirteen years.”</p>

<p>“Thirteen years,” repeated Mr. Willard musingly,
and then with great impressiveness he added:</p>

<p>“Young man, I’ve got an idea regarding you—an
idea; yes, sir, and it shall be carried out—yes, sir, it
shall be carried out—yes, sir.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="smaller">A WELL EARNED REWARD.</span></h2>

<p>Buck Kennon smarted so much under the castigation
of Mr. Willard that he had hardly stopped his
outcries when he reached home. In answer to the
demands of his startled father, he stated that a big
man, with a cane as large as a telegraph pole, had
tried to kill him and came pretty nigh succeeding.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennon was naturally stirred by the news
and set out to investigate. He was a sensible man,
but could not be expected to submit tamely to such
an outrage upon his offspring. He learned, after
due inquiry, that the offending gentleman was Mr.
Willard, the newly elected congressman. Seeking
him out, he received the facts from that person, who
expressed the regret that opportunity was denied
him for making his punishment more complete.
Mr. Kennon, as I have said, was a sensible man and
told Mr. Willard that he had served his boy right.
In fact, he was so well pleased that he promised to
vote for him if he should run a second time for
congress. Then Mr. Kennon strode homeward, and,
as he expressed it, made his hopeful “dance,” for
his cowardly behavior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The occurrence became so generally known that
it reached the ears of Mr. Bryton, the teacher, who
instituted a committee of inquiry of his own, with
the result that Buck was call upon to answer again
for his flagrant breach of discipline, so that it may
be said, the mean behavior of the bully received its
full meed of punishment. The teacher talked
severely to James Decker, but felt obliged to add
that, after all, he could not blame him for his
chivalrous course.</p>

<p>“It is always manly to defend the helpless, but I
don’t like fighting; it is brutalizing and I’m afraid
if you keep on, James, you will end in being a full
back on some football club. Then all hope will be
lost.”</p>

<p>Some nights after the exciting incident, Mr. Willard
called upon his old friend, Mr. Decker. As the
gentlemen sat by themselves, smoking their cigars
and discussing public questions, the caller suddenly
remarked:</p>

<p>“Decker, do you know you have got a mighty
bright boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes; James is a good lad.”</p>

<p>“He’s as full of pluck as an egg is of meat. You
heard about his fight with that big bully who tried
to impose upon the Goodwin cripple boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, James told me about it; I was glad you
arrived when you did; for you not only gave the
scamp a good castigation, but saved James from
being badly beaten.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that; I think the bully suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the most, even though he was on top when
I appeared on the scene. There’s another fact
which gives me pleasure.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bryton, the teacher, tells me that your son
is his brightest pupil.”</p>

<p>“Since he has told me and his mother the same
thing, there must be some truth in the statement.
It is a source of gratitude to me that James does so
well.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with him?”</p>

<p>“I have hardly given the matter thought. He is
only thirteen years old, and there’s time enough to
think of that. I presume he will be a lawyer or
doctor or minister, though,” qualified the parent.
“I’m afraid that he may not take quietly to a calling
of peace.”</p>

<p>“There’s no reason why he should not. What I
meant to say is this: if I am elected to serve a
second term, I shall have the appointment of a
cadet to West Point; James will be of the right
age; if you desire him to go there, I will make the
promise now to appoint him.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind, Mr. Willard; I will talk over
the matter with his mother and with James himself.
If they all like it, I will be glad to avail myself of
your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Take my advice and accept; I have already had
a number of applications, though the appointment
is nearly three years off. I have made no promises
and, understand, that it is yours, if you wish it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Some days later the gentlemen met again.</p>

<p>“Mr. Willard,” said his friend, “James is eager
to go to West Point; his mother held off at first,
but has given her consent, and I favor the scheme
very much. So I accept your promise with
thanks.”</p>

<p>“We will consider it settled then. Keep the
matter a secret until after the next election, for I
shall make any number of enemies because of the
disappointments.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Willard, let me make a suggestion to you.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to hear it.”</p>

<p>“As you say, you will receive many applications
for this appointment, and if you fail to promise
every one before your election comes around again,
each man will be your opponent. It has become
quite fashionable to select the candidates for the
Military Academy by competitive examination.
Do so in this case.”</p>

<p>“But I wish your son to receive the honor and
that may jeopardize his success.”</p>

<p>“If he cannot secure the appointment by a fair
contest against all comers, I don’t wish him to get
it. I have been told that less than one half of those
admitted to West Point succeed in being graduated,
and in many cases the vacancies are unfilled because
of the poor material sent by congressmen.”</p>

<p>“That I know to be a fact, and you have named
the right cause. A brilliant lad may prove to be
physically weak, while one physically strong is
mentally deficient. The government has reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
complain that so much time, labor and money are
wasted because of this state of things.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that the true means of meeting
this objection is through competitive examinations.
The advantage is not only that the government
secures the best qualified young men, but you will
escape a great deal of fault finding. You can let it
be known that, when you have an appointment at
your disposal, that you will decide it by a competitive
test. That places all on the same level, and
though some parents will be dissatisfied, you will
receive much less blame. So you see, Mr. Willard,
that it will be a wise procedure, whatever view you
take of it.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of your suggestion; I think I shall
follow it. The only objection I feel is that possibly
your boy may be crowded aside by some one else.”</p>

<p>“I shall not complaint if such proves the fact.
He has several years in which to prepare himself;
he possesses a fine physique; he is anxious for the
appointment, and, if all this is not sufficient to
secure it, then it will be certain to go to some one
who is better entitled to the same.”</p>

<p>The disastrous consequences of Buck Kennon’s
collision with James Decker had a most salutary
effect upon him. He was subdued and thoughtful,
and ceased in a great measure his oppressive course
toward his classmates.</p>

<p>It is probable that this would have been the fact,
had not his father and teacher taken a hand in reforming
him. He could not forget that, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was able to outwrestle the young champion, the
latter really inflicted the most punishment, and
what struck Buck as strange, young Decker did not
show any fear of him. James was too manly to
exult over him, but he gave Buck to understand
that if he acted again as he had toward the crippled
Almon, a second fight was certain. On the whole,
Buck decided that it was wise not to invite another
bout at arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Willard followed the suggestion of his friend,
Herbert Decker. He announced, shortly after his
second election to Congress, that the West Point
vacancy in his district would be filled by competitive
examination, on a certain date which was
named, so that no possible misunderstanding could
follow.</p>

<p>In accordance with the custom, recommended by
the authorities, this date was so arranged that the
appointment would occur one year before the time
of the application of the candidate at West Point.
Young Decker, by a little figuring, discovered that,
if he should be the successful contestant, he would
attain the required age just one week before taking
his eventful journey up the Hudson, to learn
whether Uncle Sam would pronounce him qualified
to become one of his future generals and leaders of
his armies.</p>

<p>And now let us pass over the intervening years
to the day fixed for the test of scholarship and
ability. Mr. Bryton had been selected by Congressman
Willard to pass upon the merits of the thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
odd candidates who presented themselves on the
decisive day. The honorable gentleman himself
was present, and expressed his pleasure as he looked
into the faces of the boys, who were mostly alert
and fully alive to the task before them.</p>

<p>To his eye James Decker was the brightest and
must promising of all. Looking down from the platform,
he caught his eye and smiled encouragingly.
James was tall, handsome, and manly. His frame
had expanded and hardened a good deal in the intervening
years, for he was one of those boys who
possessed a healthy mind in a healthy body.</p>

<p>He was the captain of the leading baseball club
and its best player. He had become that which his
teacher dreaded, full back on a football eleven, but
he never indulged in “slugging,” or received any
serious injury. He was a good runner and swimmer,
and, when Buck Kennon looked at him, he thought
that he would as soon tackle a full-grown grizzly
bear as engage him in a test of physical ability.
Conditions had greatly changed in the few years
since that first collision of the lads.</p>

<p>“Of course,” remarked Mr. Willard to Teacher
Bryton, “I wish this to be a competitive examination
and, therefore, to be perfectly impartial, but—that
is—I am very hopeful that—or—James may
be successful.”</p>

<p>“He has every chance in his favor,” replied the
examiner, with a quiet smile at the earnestness of
the gentleman.</p>

<p>“He has maintained the high standard he showed
when I first made his acquaintance?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fully so; there is no boy in the school that is
his equal.”</p>

<p>“I would have no anxiety if it was confined to
this school, but you know it takes in my whole congressional
district. More than half these boys are
from outside Burkville, and there’s no saying what
will be the result; there may be one or two prodigies
among them.”</p>

<p>“That is possible, though I think, if your district
had any prodigies, I would have heard of them; I
am not afraid,” said the teacher, with a glow of
pride, “to pit my school against any similar institution
in city or country.”</p>

<p>“You are warranted in saying that; you deserve
credit for the fine reputation you have given it.”</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Bryton announced that the
hour devoted to the subject of history had expired,
and he would collect the papers. He passed round
the room and took the documents in turn from the
young men, whom he told that the next hour would
be devoted to grammar.</p>

<p>The questions on the subject of grammar had been
written on the blackboard, but were hidden from
sight until now. Drawing aside the large map
which had concealed them, the teacher directed the
boys to go to work. From his elevation on the
platform, he could detect any attempt on the part
of one to help another, and this was his principal
occupation, except when talking with his friend at
his elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Suppose you take a look through the papers,”
suggested Mr. Willard.</p>

<p>“Would you like to examine several of them?”
asked Mr. Bryton, but the congressman spoiled the
compliment by exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Gracious! I couldn’t tell whether half the answers
are right. What little I ever knew about
history was forgotten long ago, and, as for grammar,
I doubt whether I can tell a conjunction from a
noun.”</p>

<p>“You do yourself injustice,” laughed the teacher,
who selected James Decker’s papers from the collection.
His experienced eye ran rapidly down the
pages, making little jots in the way of memoranda,
until he reached the end.</p>

<p>“How has he made out?” anxiously asked Mr.
Willard.</p>

<p>“His papers are perfect; I have marked him one
hundred.”</p>

<p>“Good! none can beat that.”</p>

<p>“Some, however, may equal it. Let me look
through these, which are very neatly prepared.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, those papers also were perfect as
were the third. Mr. Willard began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p>“The questions are comparatively easy; the real
test will be in mathematics, which is the favorite
branch at West Point. That is the last subject and
will occupy two hours this afternoon.”</p>

<p>It proved to be as the examiner had stated.
Although six candidates held their own in all other
studies, yet in the severest test of all, mathematics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
James Decker drew away from them and came
out ahead of every one else.</p>

<p>It will be understood with what pleasure Mr.
Willard sent in the name of Decker to the secretary
of war, as his nominee for the vacant West
Point cadetship.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">DANGER IN THE AIR.</span></h2>

<p>The selection of a candidate by competitive
examination for the United States Military Academy
at West Point has not the slightest effect upon
his admission to that institution. When he knocks
at the door he stands precisely upon the same footing
as if he were a country lad from the backwoods
of Illinois or the plains of one of the territories.
His selection simply carries with it the probability
that he is the best qualified of the numerous youths
living in his congressional district who are seeking
the appointment.</p>

<p>James Decker joined the little multitude that
were put through the severe ordeal which awaits
every candidate who has a chance of becoming an
officer of the United States army by means of the
best military institution in the world. He was hopeful
but anxious, as is every young man. The first
damper he received was when two other lads, who
seemed to be fine specimens of young American
manhood, and were his companions in the preliminary
efforts were rejected. One was from California
and broke down on the mental test. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was a tall, stoop-shouldered youth from Kentucky,
who was declared physically deficient.</p>

<p>The ordeal through which James passed brought
out the cold perspiration all over his body. He
was literally tested from the crown of his head to
the soles of his feet. When the medical board found
no physical defect, he was set to work answering
questions relating to his scholarship. This occupied
three days, and when completed, the great burden
was lifted from his shoulders, by the notice that he
had passed successfully and was a plebe.</p>

<p>This was the opening of a most trying experience.
Hazing is reduced to the minimum at West Point,
but enough of it remains to test the spirits of a
proud boy. The plebes have to play the part, more
or less, of servants to the upper classmen, who are
sometimes so oppressive that the young cadet
rebels. He is foolish to do so, but occasionally it is
inevitable. James was on the point more than
once of challenging his persecutor to a bout at
arms, but he gained a great victory over himself by
passing through the first year without anything of
the kind.</p>

<p>The collision came during his second year and
was settled one bright morning in spring, by a
battle near the ruins of old Fort Putnam, in the
presence of some twenty members of the different
classes who were in the secret. Young Decker’s
opponent had made himself unbearably obnoxious,
and when he was utterly and overwhelmingly
defeated, many of his own classmates were glad of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
it. The violation of the rules did not reach the
authorities, and Cadet Decker was involved in
nothing more of the kind during the four years
spent at the institution.</p>

<p>Young Decker maintained a high grade of scholarship
throughout his course. Once he stood second
in his class, but dropped slightly, and when he was
graduated his standing was five. This entitled
him to enter the corps of engineers, or to take his
choice of the branches below that.</p>

<p>“The cavalry is the arm of the service that suits
me,” he said to his roommate, who was from
Alabama.</p>

<p>“It isn’t half so good as the engineers or artillery,”
remarked his friend, who expected to be
assigned to the latter. “I look upon the engineers
as the real, ornamental branch of the service.”</p>

<p>“And that’s the reason I want none of it,” replied
Decker; “I am going into the army to make a
record and win promotion.”</p>

<p>“The engineers have a good thing; you are sure
to be assigned to one of the large cities on the sea-coast
or to Washington, where you have plenty of
society and many social privileges, with little hard
work.”</p>

<p>“Promotion is slow in the artillery; the only
chance is a foreign war, and I don’t see any prospect
of that. The Indian troubles in the Southwest
give the cavalry plenty to do. Geronimo and the
rest are making things lively, and whoever goes
down there won’t be allowed to rust to death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” smiled his friend, “it will be a poisoned
arrow or a rifle bullet or scalping knife. Then the
climate is something like that of hades.”</p>

<p>“All that may be as you say, but after an experience
of a few years there a fellow will be able to
appreciate the soft snaps elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“But some of those posts in Arizona and New Mexico,”
persisted his classmate, “are enough to drive a
fellow wild. A cousin of mine, now a captain of
cavalry, told me that the years he spent at Fort
Grant were such that he would not go through
again for the biggest fortune in the world. The
hot sun, the daily parade and grind, the same old
round of duty day in and out for weeks, months and
years in that confounded climate were enough to
drive a person crazy.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he have any campaigning?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it; everything was as calm as a mill
pond.”</p>

<p>“That’s the difference; it would be the last place
I would go, if it were not for the prospect of something
in the way of fighting. I have been studying
matters and making inquiries, and there is reason to
hope that things will hum in the Southwest before
you and I have time to grow our mustaches.”</p>

<p>“Well, Decker, you are welcome to it; give me
the artillery.”</p>

<p>So it came about in the natural order of things
that Second-Lieutenant Decker was assigned to Fort
Reno in Arizona. Full of ambition and hope, he
bade his friends good-by and made the long journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to that section, his spirits unaffected by the flaming
weather and the desolate appearance of the half
civilized region through which he was compelled to
pass, a portion by stage and much by horseback.</p>

<p>The letter which Lieutenant Decker wrote to his
old classmate, who had a pleasant berth at Washington,
was not precisely what he expected to write
when bidding him farewell.</p>

<p>“But for the prospect of active service,” he said,
“I would agree with many of my old friends, including
yourself, that I made a great mistake. This
is one of the most frightful regions of our glorious
country. If it was not that the atmosphere is dry
no one could stand it. Human beings would be
driven out as from Sahara, but no one knows what
he can undergo until he makes the experiment.
Trouble is certain to come with the Apaches and I am
as confident as ever that if I can bring my scalp
out of the flurry I shall win promotion, which you
know is the dream of all of us.”</p>

<p>Having located the brave young lieutenant in his
new quarters, with his dreams of glory, some attention
must now be given to others with whose fortunes
he became closely identified before he had
spent a year at Fort Reno in Arizona.</p>

<p>Maurice Freeman was a veteran of the Southern
Confederacy, who had moved into the section
nearly two years before Lieutenant Decker was assigned
to that post. His family consisted of his
wife Molly, his little boy Fulton and a girl Fannie.
It was on a pleasant day in winter, when the climate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in that region is delightful, that Freeman set
out to ride to Fort Reno, ten miles distant from his
ranch.</p>

<p>The ranchman was accustomed to make periodical
visits to the military post, where he had a pleasant
acquaintance with the officers and received a cordial
welcome and courteous treatment. There were
many little articles which he could obtain there
that were useful to his family and which, therefore,
rendered unnecessary, except at distant intervals,
his journeys to Prescott, Phœnix, Tombstone and
the other comparatively large towns.</p>

<p>Freeman was riding at a brisk pace, for his animal
was excellent and the weather favorable. Ascending
a gentle slope, some distance from Salt
River, a tributary of the Gila, he checked his pony
and looked off over the broad stretch of country
spread out before him, with a winding branch of
the Gila showing at varying distances across the
undulating plain.</p>

<p>But the scene was so familiar that it excited little
interest and he had not paused to admire it; he
was looking for friends or enemies, as the case might
prove to be.</p>

<p>His scrutiny of the sandy expanse was not in
vain, for the first sweeping glance revealed three
horsemen to the northwest, all galloping at a swift
pace, and heading toward him.</p>

<p>“Who can they be?” he asked himself, shading
his eyes with his hand and peering intently in that
direction. “If I had a glass, I could make them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
out, but they will soon disclose themselves, for they
seem to be in a hurry.”</p>

<p>It was early in the afternoon, and since nothing
was to be gained by remaining where he was, the
ranchman spoke to his horse, which instantly broke
into an easy, swinging pace toward the others, who
were studying the single man as closely as he was
trying to make them out.</p>

<p>“Just what I expected,” exclaimed Freeman;
“it’s Lieutenant Decker from the fort, and he has
Mendez and Cemuri with him. Decker would
rather fight than eat, and if I’m not mistaken he
will have enough of it before he sees much service
in this part of the world. Geronimo has been quiet
so long that it’s time he was heard of again, and
when the old fellow moves the fur will fly.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker, as might be supposed, was
fond of scouting through the country, as his superiors
permitted, and when rumors came to the post
that the Apaches were becoming restless once
more he was reckless enough to declare that he
hoped the news would prove true.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything more irksome,” he was
wont to repeat, “than to be stationed at one of
these posts, with nothing going on but the same
monotonous drill and parade, day after day, week
after week, and through the months from one
year’s end to the other. If Geronimo will stir up
things, I’ll do my part to keep them going.”</p>

<p>Mendez and Cemuri, both of whom were in
middle life, were among the very best scouts that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
had served under Generals Crook and Miles.
They were White Mountain Apaches, whose loyalty
was never under a cloud. They had given invaluable
help in more than one critical emergency,
and, esteemed as they were by our officers and
soldiers, they were intensely hated by their own
people, who when forced to cease their hostilities,
were sullen, ugly, revengeful, and given to brooding
over their wrongs.</p>

<p>What more natural than that while hating the
white race, they should regard with unspeakable
detestation those of their own people who had aided
that race in conquering them? Mendez and
Cemuri knew that they took their lives in their
hands, when they helped the white men to hunt
down the Apache desperadoes, a score of whom were
enough to throw the settlements, over an area of
hundreds of miles, into consternation and terror.</p>

<p>The fact that Lieutenant Decker and these two
friendly scouts were riding thus far from Fort
Reno, was evidence that they were out on the same
duty that had taken them scores of miles, many a
time within the past weeks.</p>

<p>The young man made a military salute as he recognized
Captain Freeman, and all four drew down
their horses to a walk and quickly came to a standstill.
The lieutenant’s white teeth shone under his
dark mustache as he smiled, and, looking at the
oval face, much bronzed under the Arizona sun, the
clear bright eyes, the slightly aquiline nose and the
fine figure, Captain Freeman thought he was the
handsomest young officer he had ever met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Mendez and Cemuri remained a few paces in the
background, as the two white men halted with
their knees almost touching each other. The
Apaches had nothing to say unless appealed to, but
were always ready for action, when called upon.</p>

<p>“On another scout, lieutenant?” was the inquiring
remark of Freeman.</p>

<p>“Yes; we have been off toward the Gila; these
fellows say that Geronimo and about twenty of his
band have been there within the past three days,
but we didn’t get a glimpse of them. I’m afraid it’s
a false alarm.”</p>

<p>“You’re <em>afraid</em> it is! Don’t you hope so?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the young officer, removing his
cap and drawing his handkerchief over his forehead,
“I suppose I ought to feel that way, for the worst
devils with copper skins are those that bear the
name of Apache, but when you have to fight it’s a
pleasure to know that you are not fighting ninnies
and lambs.”</p>

<p>“But no pleasure, as I view it, to fight savages,
who violate every rule of civilized warfare, who are
more cruel than death itself, treacherous, fierce,
relentless and merciless to men, women and children.
Lieutenant,” added Freeman gravely, “I
must say that while I believe you are a brave young
man, I don’t like the hope you show that those
miscreants should break loose again. I surrendered
with Lee at Appomattox and was all through the
war. I was wounded and saw hundreds killed, but
I would rather go into a battle like the Wilderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
or Gettysburg or Antietam than know that a single
band of hostile Apaches were raiding through this
section. When the North and South fought, each
knew the bravery and chivalry of the other, and we
never hit a foe when he was down. Here we
are fighting rattlesnakes.”</p>

<p>“Well, captain, I often felt sorry that I wasn’t
born twenty years sooner, or that you had waited
that long before opening on Fort Sumter, but the
unpleasantness between the sections is over; promotion
is slow, and unless we can have something
to stir us up, there’s no saying how long I shall
have to wait for my first lieutenancy or captaincy,
to say nothing of the eagles of the colonelcy far,
far beyond.”</p>

<p>“Your talk shows that you are young,” said
Freeman, who, despite the reproof in his voice, could
not help admiring the manly youth of whom he was
very fond; “five or ten years from now your sentiments
will be more in accord with mine.”</p>

<p>“I can’t deny that your strictures are just; you
have a wife and two children——”</p>

<p>“And there are many others with similar ties;
some had them once, but have them no longer; you
know the cause.”</p>

<p>“Of course, and therefore I am the more anxious
to get at those miscreants. So long as they can
range up and down the country, burning, shooting
and killing without receiving punishment therefor,
so long will they keep it up; but, captain, the thing
has got to end some time, and the sooner the final
struggle begins the sooner will it terminate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a big field for discussion, which it isn’t
worth while for us to enter; but sometimes I
wonder whether, if the right course had been pursued,
this trouble would not have ended long ago.”</p>

<p>“Of course it would,” broke in the lieutenant
with some heat; “if the management of the
Indians had been left to the army, there would
have been mighty little fighting, for the redskins
would have been treated honestly, and that’s all
they ask. It’s the Indian ring at Washington that
raises the mischief; they’re continually poking their
nose into our affairs, and when Crook or Miles gets
everything running smoothly, those scoundrels
arrange for a big swindle and divvy.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked round at the stolid faces of
the two dusky scouts, as if to learn whether they
were listening.</p>

<p>“I don’t think there’s any danger of their reporting
me, but I wish we could have the whole gang of
plunderers right here and put them in front, when
we start on a chase after Geronimo and his hostiles.”</p>

<p>“It would be a mighty good thing if you could,”
assented Freeman, who had seen much of the
frightful mismanagement of Indian affairs; “but
it is as it was during the civil war: the men who
yell the loudest for a fight are those who stay at
home. No fear of any one of them showing himself
within reach of a hostile. However we have
got to take things as they are. We are confronted
by a condition, not a theory. We are in danger
from the worst warriors that ever scalped a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
or dashed out the brains of a baby. If the Apaches
are likely to make a raid through this section, I
must look after my family, who are peculiarly exposed,
as is the family of Captain Murray.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the lieutenant thoughtfully, “you and
he are neighbors, and both of your homes are in
great peril—halloo!” he added looking around;
“Mendez seems to have discovered something.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">GERONIMO.</span></h2>

<p>Having descended the elevation to meet his three
friends, Captain Freeman, like them, was on a broad
open plain, which bore some suggestion of a valley.
For a mile to the westward a ridge rose to a height of
several hundred feet. On the other side of this
ridge and close to it, wound a tributary of the Salt
River. The stream was narrow, but of uncertain
depth, being shallow in many places, while in others
it could be crossed only by swimming.</p>

<p>To the westward the sandy plain extended,
slightly undulating, until it faded from view in the
distant horizon. Ten miles to the northeast was
Fort Reno, and at a somewhat less distance, and
almost due south, in the Sutra Valley, were the
ranches of Captain Freeman and his friend Captain
Murray, a Union veteran of the war. The two
were strongly attached to each other and their
families were intimate.</p>

<p>The reader will note the peculiar condition of
things. If Geronimo or any of his fierce Apaches
made a raid into the section, they would come from
the westward, that is from the direction of Prescott
or Phœnix, or possibly from the south. Should they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
succeed in passing the scouts that were out searching
for them, the country to the east would be exposed,
and in that section were a number of families,
besides the two already named.</p>

<p>The great point, therefore, was to prevent the red
men from penetrating so far to the east. If they
could be checked or turned back, the scattered settlers
would be safe but if the subtle and merciless
warriors flanked and passed in behind the soldiers
and scouts, serious mischief was sure to follow.</p>

<p>Tidings that Geronimo had left the reservation
and was on the war path was brought to Fort Reno
by Mendez and Cemuri, who had caught glimpses
of several of the terrible raiders. It must not be
supposed that the colonel at the post contented himself
with sending out Lieutenant Decker and the
two scouts alone, for that would have been a piece
of folly which the experienced Indian fighter could
not have committed. The supposition was that
twenty at least of Geronimo’s savage followers were
ranging through the country, and fully that number
of white men and scouts were seeking to checkmate
them.</p>

<p>Decker and his two White Mountain guides
formed only one of several parties engaged on
the same business. These parties expected to keep
within signalling or communicating distance and
to join forces, should it become necessary.</p>

<p>It has been said that while Lieutenant Decker
and Captain Freeman were holding their brief,
spirited conversation, the two friendly Apaches, sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
their horses a short distance back, taking no part
in what was said, and for a time not even speaking
to each other.</p>

<p>It would have been an interesting study, however,
could any one have watched them. They continually
turned their heads, as if trying to decide from
what point of the compass, some slight almost indistinguishable
sound came. Their fine sense of
hearing was supplemented by a vision trained to the
highest conceivable point, and the keen black eyes
were scarcely at rest for an instant. Here, there,
everywhere the penetrating glances shot, flitting
from point to point so quickly that it would seem
they could not grasp anything in their field of
vision. All the same, however, nothing escaped
them.</p>

<p>It should be said that each of the four men was
heavily armed. Freeman and the young officer
carried respectively a fine Winchester and revolver,
while the scouts had a formidable knife apiece in addition
to those weapons. The officer was in uniform,
with his sword, and Freeman’s costume suggested
that of the professional cowboy, with the broad-brimmed
hat, loose, flowing shirt, cartridge belt,
excellent accouterments for his horse and large
spurs for himself.</p>

finger at the ridge.—<a href="#Page_35">Page 35.</a></p>

<p class="caption-r">—<i>The Young Scout.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Mendez and Cemuri made some pretense of wearing
civilized costume, though their clothing could
hardly have found a purchaser at a second-hand
sale. They never covered their heads, the long,
coarse black hair dangling about their faces and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
shoulders, with occasionally a stained feather projecting
from the crown. No paint disfigured the
countenances, which in fact could not have been
made to look uglier, but they had the cartridge
belt, trousers and leggings of the cowboy, most of
which they would have been glad to dispense with,
but respect for the prejudices of their white
brethren forbade.</p>

<p>Mendez was glancing toward all points of the
compass, in that quick, fitful way named, when he
suddenly fixed his eyes on the ridge to the westward.
The fact that he did not change his gaze for
fully a minute was proof that something had
attracted his suspicion, and the faint exclamation
which followed was proof that an additional discovery
had been made or that the suspicion had
become conviction.</p>

<p>The two white men instantly ceased talking and
looked at him. He did not turn his head, but
peered with the same intensity as at first.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, Mendez?” asked the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Huh! ’Pache ober dere,” was the reply, accompanied
by a pointing of his dusky finger at the
ridge.</p>

<p>The other three were gazing in the same direction.
Whether Cemuri was equally fortunate could not
be decided, for he gave no sign. Neither the
lieutenant nor captain detected anything with the
naked eye. The former drew out his fieldglass and
directed it at the point of interest, holding it leveled
for several minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The ridge like the plain was of sand. Not so
much as a mesquite bush was to be seen in any
direction. Here and there grew a species of sand
grass, which seems to thrive where there is no earth
nourishment, while an occasional prickly cactus
added to the desolateness of the scene. There was
nothing, therefore, to interfere with the vision in
any direction.</p>

<p>“I’m blessed if I can see anything unusual!”
exclaimed the lieutenant, passing his instrument to
Freeman, with the remark, “Maybe you can do
better.”</p>

<p>But the elder was no more successful than the
younger. The latter turned to Mendez, upon
whose face were the faint indications of a smile, and
asked:</p>

<p>“What was it you saw?”</p>

<p>“One—two—tree ’Pache crawl up ridge—look
ober—see dere eyes!”</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that the scout should have
been able to detect this fact—if it was a fact—at
that distance, and yet we have the record that
Tycho Brahe, hundreds of years ago, did as well in
the same line and his visual powers could not have
received finer training than those of this White
Mountain Apache.</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” remarked the lieutenant, smilingly
shaking his head; “I had the record at the
Point of being able to see a professor further than
any of the cadets, but I wasn’t equal to that.”</p>

<p>“By heavens! he’s right!” exclaimed Freeman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
who was still holding the instrument pointed
toward the ridge; “<em>he</em> doesn’t need a spyglass.”</p>

<p>“When you are through, let me try it again.”</p>

<p>Freeman handed the glass to the lieutenant, who,
being shown the exact point toward which to direct
it, did so with much doubt and misgiving as to the
result.</p>

<p>“Just as I supposed!” he muttered impatiently;
“all imagination——”</p>

<p>When he first used the instrument he saw nothing
besides the bare, sandy elevation, but the words
were yet in his mouth, when, on the very crest of
the ridge, something resembling a crow came into
sight. His first thought was that one of those birds
or a buzzard had hopped up from the other side, and
was peering over, but a moment’s scrutiny left no
doubt that it was the head of an Apache Indian,
for it could belong to no other tribe and act in this
manner, the circumstances being as they were.</p>

<p>While Decker was studying the miscreant, who
took care to expose only his forehead down to his
eyes, a second head appeared at its side, the movements
being precisely the same. The third, however,
of which Mendez had spoken, did not show itself.</p>

<p>The hostiles must have believed their presence
unsuspected, or at least not known of a certainty to
the four horsemen, for they lay on their faces and
peered for a long time over the crest of the elevation.</p>

<p>“I apologize, Mendez,” said the lieutenant in his
cheery manner; “your powers of vision surpass anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
I ever met. Will you please tell me when the
Apache on the right winks his eye?”</p>

<p>The scout, however, was too dignified to pay
attention to this attempted witticism. He gazed
long and steadily at the two heads faintly showing,
and then Freeman, who was watching his countenance,
noted that his eyes were wandering along the
ridge, evidently in search of other ominous
evidence.</p>

<p>All at once his gaze was arrested. He was looking
at a point fully a hundred yards to the right of
where the crowns of the enemies had been discerned
and had detected something.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mendez?” asked the lieutenant,
bringing his glass again into use.</p>

<p>“’Pache,” was the response; “look dere!”</p>

<p>The scout was right, as Decker was quick to
learn. In this instance, however, the buck did not
content himself with simply peering over the
elevation. He seemed to be creeping forward until
he reached the crest of the ridge, when he raised
the upper part of his body, so that his face and
shoulders were in sight. In this posture he was
evidently studying the four horsemen.</p>

<p>“Mendez,” said the lieutenant; “you have the
best pair of eyes I ever heard of, but no person has
eyes which cannot be helped by a glass like this.
You know that as well as I, for I’ve seen you use a
fieldglass. Now, since that buck off yonder isn’t
afraid to show his ugly countenance, see what you
can make of him with the aid of the instrument.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The scout complied with the request. As the
officer had stated the scout knew how to use the
glass and it brought a revelation. He leveled it at
that hard, wrinkled, peering countenance lifted
above the distant ridge, and scrutinized it with the
intensity of a man seeking to read his own fate.</p>

<p>Only a few moments were thus occupied, when he
passed the instrument back to its owner who
observed the peculiar half-smiling expression on his
usually stolid countenance.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen that buck before?” asked
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Seen him—one—two—tree—hundred times.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Geronimo!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">COMPLIMENTS AT LONG RANGE.</span></h2>

<p>Geronimo, as every reader of these pages knows,
has been a “good Indian” for many years. He
makes his home among civilized people, has acted as
usher at the dedication of a schoolhouse and
believes in education. No fault can be found with
the old chieftain in these times, but only a few
years ago, he was the most terrible scourge of the
southwest border.</p>

<p>The outrages committed by him and his desperadoes
are matters of history, as are the hardships and
sufferings undergone by our soldiers in their desperate
efforts to run him to earth. There was a
universal sigh of relief among the ranches and
settlements of Arizona, when it became known of a
certainty that Geronimo and his principal associates
had been taken eastward and would never again be
permitted to place foot west of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>We are writing of the trying period preceding
the capture of this Apache, when the mention of his
name caused an involuntary shudder on the part
of the bravest man.</p>

<p>Mendez had given such incontestible proof of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
astonishing power of vision, that when he handed
back the fieldglass and announced that the Indian,
a mile away, was that ferocious chieftain no one
doubted him.</p>

<p>The lieutenant passed the instrument to Cemuri
with the request that he would make use of it. The
fellow hesitated but did as desired. A moment
after he pointed the glass westward, the Indian, as
if aware of his own recklessness, sank down until as
in the case of his companions, only the top of his
head and forehead was visible.</p>

<p>But the second scout secured a good view the
moment before this took place.</p>

<p>“Mendez right—he Geronimo,” remarked Cemuri,
as if that being settled no further interest attached
to their arch enemy.</p>

<p>“Since that is the case, it is probable that his
whole band is with him. If I had the rest of the
boys at hand, we would sail in and hustle those
bucks westward faster than they came eastward.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t them at hand,” observed Freeman,
“so there isn’t much chance of doing anything
against the party.”</p>

<p>Having “located” Geronimo and his band, the
next question for the lieutenant to decide was what
should be done. Brave as was the young officer (and
his companions were equally brave) it would have
been madness to attack a company of Apaches,
fully armed and on the warpath, and who outnumbered
them four or five to one.</p>

<p>Those cunning warriors were at home in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sandy waste and nothing would have pleased them
better than to be assailed. No doubt they were
keeping well out of sight in the hope of drawing on
the little company of horsemen, who, had they ridden
over the ridge, as there seemed a likelihood of their
doing, would have entered a trap from which there
was no extrication.</p>

<p>“We must make connection with some of the
boys who are scouting,” remarked the lieutenant;
“then when we are strong enough we’ll give
Geronimo a tussle. If it should be my good fortune
to wipe him out what a feather it would be in my
cap!”</p>

<p>“And if it should be his bad fortune to wipe <em>you</em>
out,” suggested Freeman; “where would be your
feather?”</p>

<p>Decker shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Honors that are not hardly earned are not
honors. We’ll ride to the right, and see whether
we cannot gain a better sight of them. It may be
that this is only a part of the main band, and if so
we’ll have a fight.”</p>

<p>The scheme seemed to be the only one feasible
and was followed. The clear sunshiny afternoon
was drawing to a close and nothing could be hoped
for, in holding their motionless position in the midst
of the low, valley-like depression.</p>

<p>The young officer struck his horse to a moderate
gallop, with Freeman at his side and the scouts following
closely at the rear, grim, silent and watchful.
The hostiles whose heads had been showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
above the ridge vanished from sight and there was
no saying what their course of action would be.</p>

<p>Had not the contour of the country been favorable,
there would have been an imprudent risk in
the course of Lieutenant Decker; for it is evident
that it would have been easy for the hostiles to shift
their position along the ridge so as still to confront
the whites who would have ridden into the trap that
has already been described.</p>

<p>But a comparatively short distance to the right,
the moderate elevation sloped down to the level of the
plain, permitting a view of the winding stream
which further to the left passed out of sight behind
the ridge. The Apaches could not advance upon
this without being observed, though (so wonderful
is their cunning) had they been given more time,
they would have formed an ambush, where neither
wood nor elevation gave screen or protection. It
would not have been the first time that members
of that tribe have performed this seemingly impossible
feat.</p>

<p>The promptness of the four horsemen prevented
such a trap. They swung forward at a swift gallop,
until the ridge was flanked and their position admitted
a view of both sides for a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>The result was interesting. Four warriors were
in plain view, all mounted on their tough ponies
and facing the white men and scouts. A space of a
fourth of a mile separated the parties, when they
thus confronted each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The Apaches immediately began tantalizing the
whites, in the hope of inducing them to attack. They
swung their blankets aloft, shouted, and Geronimo,
riding out a short distance from his companions, deliberately
fired his rifle at the horsemen. He had
a good weapon, for the singing of the bullet was
heard as it passed over the heads of his enemies.</p>

<p>“I can be as polite as you,” remarked Lieutenant
Decker, bringing his Winchester to his shoulder and
letting fly.</p>

<p>He aimed at the chieftain, and nothing would have
delighted him more than to see him pitch from the
back of his pony, but the distance was too great to
make the aim accurate and the leader suffered no
more harm than had his enemies at his hands.</p>

<p>“Mendez,” said the young officer, turning to his
principal scout; “do you think it likely there are
only four of the Apaches? If such is your belief
we’ll charge them.”</p>

<p>The sagacious scout grimly shook his head.</p>

<p>“More—plenty more—hide in sand—want us to
fight ’em.”</p>

<p>“But where are their ponies?”</p>

<p>“Hide ’em easy—lay down—cover ’em wid sand—go
in water—only nose stick out.”</p>

<p>Nothing would have pleased Geronimo more
than to be attacked. In his broken English he
called out taunts so insulting that the swarthy cheek
of Lieutenant Decker flushed. How he would have
leaped at the chance of a fight with him on anything
like equal terms!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The chieftain now rode his pony more than a
hundred yards in a straight line toward the group.
His animal walked slowly and his rider continued
to shout his taunts.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker, holding his horse well in
hand, advanced the same distance toward Geronimo.</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?” sternly asked
Freeman.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of myself,” was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you will or not,” added
Freeman, with no little misgiving.</p>

<p>Decker continued his guarded advance until like
his enemy, he judged he had gone far enough,
when he too halted.</p>

<p>“I’ll go as far as he dare,” he muttered; “if he
will only come far enough to be beyond the support
of his men, I’ll meet him and we can have it out
between us.”</p>

<p>Geronimo had ceased his taunting shouts, and,
with his horse perfectly motionless sat like an
equestrian statue with his gaze upon this young
David. Then he did a singular thing.</p>

<p>All four, while watching him, discovered that
instead of holding his pony stationary, as at first,
he was backing him. The well-trained animal,
keeping his nose toward the foe, was stepping
slowly backward, the movement of his legs and the
change of position being clearly seen by all.</p>

<p>Mendez and Cemuri looked at each other and
smiled; they knew what it meant. Geronimo was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
seeking to lure the young officer away from his
supports, or, better still, striving to tempt forward
the whole four, under the belief that the two forces
were equal.</p>

<p>“Don’t go any nearer!” called Freeman, growing
impatient with the recklessness of the officer; “he’s
trying to draw you on.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant made no reply. His spirited horse,
of his own volition, took two steps forward, but his
rider checked him.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Geronimo, but the fly isn’t ready to
walk into the spider’s web.”</p>

<p>Seeing the failure of his scheme, the Apache
chief, with the quickness of a flash, raised his Winchester
again and fired directly at the officer, whose
escape was quite narrow, for the interval admitted
of a fatal shot, provided it were well aimed.</p>

<p>As if to imitate every action of his enemy,
Decker brought his rifle to a level and sighted
carefully at Geronimo. It required no phenomenal
marksmanship to bring him down, and he was hopeful
of doing so, but at the moment of pressing the
trigger, the chieftain disappeared as if by magic.</p>

<p>He knew what was coming and saw his danger.
He flung himself over the side of his pony, whose
body was thus interposed as a shield. Not to be
baffled, the officer sighted as best he could and fired.</p>

<p>He did not harm the chieftain, but the bullet
passed through the brain of his pony, who, with a
cry of agony, reared on his hind legs, pawed the
air and rolled over as dead as Julius Cæsar. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
agile rider, who had no saddle, leaped free and ran
hastily back to his companions, amid the jeering
shouts of the youth who had unhorsed him.</p>

<p>“Geronimo is a squaw! He runs from the white
man! He dare not come forward and fight him!
He is afraid he will be hurt!”</p>

<p>All which, if it were so, did not change the
situation or give any additional advantage to him
who uttered the taunts.</p>

<p>Enough has been told to prove the surpassing cunning
of the two White Mountain Apaches who
served as scouts. Once they had been among the
fiercest of the followers of the fearful scourge of
the border and were fully trained in his ways.</p>

<p>Captain Freeman was an old campaigner and had
lived sufficiently long in Arizona to learn much of
the methods of the hostiles, while Lieutenant
Decker had made the matter his study for weeks.</p>

<p>And yet, despite all this and the fact that each
one of the four knew that the Apache leader and
his warriors were doing their utmost to lure the
horsemen to their ruin, the red men came within a
hair of doing so.</p>

<p>Only by the merest chance or accident or providence,
as it may be termed, was the ingenious
scheme detected in time to thwart it.</p>

<p>Naturally the eyes of the three horsemen in the
background were fixed upon Decker and Geronimo,
with glances at the warriors beyond, who were in
direct range of vision, and who were watching
events with apparently the same interest.</p>

<p>What induced Maurice Freeman to withdraw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
gaze from his young friend and their enemies he
could never explain, but he did so for a single instant,
looking to the left of the ridge, and somewhat
toward the spot where the four had been in
consultation when they first discovered the Apaches.
His eyes were roving over this sandy stretch when
he saw something move. At first glance it was as
if some burrowing animal had stirred a hummock
of sand, while the animal itself was underneath and
out of sight.</p>

<p>Wondering what it could mean, and vaguely suspecting
mischief, Freeman forgot the lieutenant
and Geronimo for a minute, while he watched
the strange manifestation.</p>

<p>To his amazement, several places in the sand were
similarly agitated, the disturbance showing that
whatever caused it was approaching the horsemen.</p>

<p>Suddenly the truth flashed upon Freeman. The
curious movement was caused by several Apache
warriors, who, it may be said, were burrowing their
way like moles through the sand, and making so
little display of what they were doing that even
Mendez and Cemuri did not detect them, and only
the merest accident, as has been shown, revealed
the dangerous artifice to Freeman.</p>

<p>The Apaches had but to approach a little closer,
when they would secure an aim which would empty
every saddle.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant!” called Freeman, “we must retreat
at once or we’ll be surrounded!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Decker did not pause for an explanation, but
whirled his horse and came tearing back on a dead
run. Before he could rejoin his comrades, they
were on the move, the scouts, now that their fears
were aroused, having been quick to learn the nature
of the peril.</p>

<p>The flight was so sudden that the Apaches, stealing
up in this ingenious manner, did not suspect the
meaning of the sudden flight until all four had
ridden some distance. Then the miscreants, of
whom there were four—just enough to carry out
the scheme—still groveling in the sand, took quick
aim and fired at the fleeing horsemen.</p>

<p>This time one of the bullets passed through the
fleshy part of Cemuri’s thigh, inflicting a painful
wound, though he made no reference to it, and it
was not discovered by his companions until some
time later.</p>

<p>It may be admitted that only one fact saved the
four from death. Each was mounted on a horse,
the equal if not the superior of any ridden by the
Apaches, although, as is well known, those people
are always provided with good animals when on
their raids. If pursued, they have the advantage of
fresh horses, continually renewed while on the run
before a superior body of pursuers.</p>

<p>The parties had been too near each other, and
without giving any time to discussion or consultation,
the four devoted the next fifteen minutes or
half an hour to skurrying off as fast as they could.
Finally, thanks to the fleetness of their animals,
they drew rein and dropped to a walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Before this the Apaches had discovered that it
was useless to try to overtake the little party and
had given up the attempt. For the present nothing
was to be feared from them.</p>

<p>“There is reason to believe they will not push
any further eastward,” said Freeman, giving expression
rather to his hope than his conviction.</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>

<p>“They have learned that their presence is known
in this neighborhood and that a force will be sent
out from the fort, if it has not already been sent—halloo!”</p>

<p>The speaker, happening to glance at Cemuri, was
shocked to observe the startling effects of his
wound. The exclamation of Freeman caused the
others to note the same, and the horses came to a
halt.</p>

<p>“That looks bad,” remarked the lieutenant; “let
me examine it.”</p>

<p>“Huh! no hurt—soon be well,” said Cemuri, with
a look of contempt, and displeased at the expressions
of sympathy.</p>

<p>“It may get well if it’s attended to,” was the
comment of Decker, who insisted upon an inspection
of the hurt.</p>

<p>It did not seem to be dangerous, but it was clear
that it required attention. From the clothing of
different ones were torn sufficient bandages to stanch
the flow, and despite the indifference of the scout
he must have felt extreme pain.</p>

<p>“I remember just such wounds in the army,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
commented Freeman; “little was thought of them
at first, but many a death came from their
neglect.”</p>

<p>“His people are tough and have little faith in
surgery.”</p>

<p>“Which may all be the case and not affect the
truth of what I have stated.”</p>

<p>When the rude service was finished, the lieutenant
said:</p>

<p>“Cemuri, you must go to the fort as soon as you
can.”</p>

<p>The dusky face showed anger and the scout shook
his head.</p>

<p>“Me no pappose—me warrior—me scout!”</p>

<p>“And a very good one too—so good that we want
to save your services to us. I don’t believe that
wound will kill you, old fellow, unless it is neglected,
but it is going to lay you up for a time. You won’t
be able to do yourself justice till your leg gets well,
and that will take place sooner at the fort than in
the saddle.”</p>

<p>Cemuri looked appealingly at Mendez. Why did
he remain mute and not come to his relief? His
opinion would have great weight.</p>

<p>But Mendez shook his head.</p>

<p>“Leg no good, for one—two—tree—many days—go
to fort—do what <em>he</em> say.”</p>

<p>The last prop knocked from under him, the brave
fellow submitted. He was sullen, and without a
word started his horse eastward toward Fort Reno.</p>

<p>“I meant to give him some orders,” remarked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
officer with a laugh; “for the colonel ought to
know the particulars, but the fellow is huffy.”</p>

<p>“He will give the colonel all the news, have no
fear about that.”</p>

<p>When Cemuri had ridden some distance, and had
time to rally from the irritation into which he was
thrown by the command of the young officer, he
must have felt that it was all for his good. He was
suffering much; he had lost strength and was so
weak, despite his indurated frame, that he felt dizzy
and weak, with occasional spells when it was hard
to keep in the saddle.</p>

<p>Night was drawing on, and he could not hope to
reach the post until long after darkness had come.
But his horse was strong and fleet, and such a thing
as failure to complete his task did not enter his
thoughts.</p>

<p>The stream which had been in sight so long now
made a sharp curve northward, so that it was speedily
left out of sight. The ride to the post was over
the same open plain which had been traversed most
of the day. The sky was clear and the moon rose
early, making the ride as pleasant as if the sun were
shining.</p>

<p>The American Indian, as all know, can bear with
equanimity more suffering and grievous wounds than
his white brother, but there is of necessity a limit to
the toughest frame that nature ever put together,
and Cemuri, the White Mountain scout, began to
suspect that he had struck or was about to strike
that limit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>He had ridden less than three miles at a swinging
gallop when he drew his horse down to a walk;
the jolting of the speedier gait was unbearable.
As he made the change of pace, he first looked
around to be sure no one saw him. Then he gave
expression to his views in the form of an English
expletive, altogether too vigorous to be recorded in
these pages.</p>

<p>In one respect the scout was specially favored:
his pony was not only well trained, but possessed
unusual intelligence. He had given his master
warning many a time of the approach of danger and
he now did it once more.</p>

<p>The slow, steady walk through the soft sand was
suddenly checked, the pretty head elevated, the
ears thrown forward, and a slightly vigorous expiration
followed through the silken nostrils, yet
not loud enough to be heard a dozen yards away.</p>

<p>There was but one possible interpretation of this
demonstration, and the rider knew on the instant
what it was. Had he been himself, he would have
remained in the saddle, but he was in no condition
to make a fight, and he deftly dismounted, despite
the stinging pain caused by moving his limb.</p>

<p>No sooner were his feet on the ground than his
pony lay down. His purpose was to lessen his
danger of discovery by an approaching enemy or
stranger. Cemuri knelt beside him with rifle ready
for instant use.</p>

<p>Hardly had these precautions been taken, when
two shadowy horsemen, barely visible through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
gloom, entered the field of vision and immediately
passed out again. They came from the direction of
the fort and were riding toward the little party of
Lieutenant Decker. They were Indians, and,
though Cemuri could not be absolutely certain in
the gathering darkness, he was convinced that they
were Maroz and Ceballos, two Apaches whom he
thoroughly distrusted.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A SIGNAL.</span></h2>

<p>Lieutenant Decker and his friends held their position
for some time after the departure of Cemuri on
his return to Fort Reno. Although they had left
the stream, which had served them as a partial
guide for a number of hours, they were not far
from it, and the young officer was inclined to think
it was the part of wisdom to stay in its vicinity.</p>

<p>The situation may be explained thus:</p>

<p>Geronimo and his band were evidently aiming to
reach the more exposed ranches and dwellings to
the eastward in the Sutra Valley, although when on
their raids it seemed to matter little to them where
they struck their terrible blows. Nothing was to
prevent the swift riders from sweeping through the
section whenever they chose, but brave and reckless
as they were, they did not shut their eyes to
peril.</p>

<p>From what had occurred they knew that their
presence was discovered and that movements were
already under way to check them. They had seen
scouts from Fort Reno, and may have known that
others were scouring the country. If the hostiles
pushed on, they might find a strong party of cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in their rear or on their flanks, with the certainty
of losing some of their best warriors before the
rest could escape.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker’s anxiety now was to open
communication with a party of his friends and
arrange an attack upon the Apaches. Could this
be done within the next few hours, Geronimo would
be frustrated and compelled to withdraw without
striking one of his fearful blows.</p>

<p>Until such junction could be effected, the officer
wished to keep up a demonstration in front of the
bucks, or show such activity that even if it failed to
turn them back, it would retard or check their raid
until the soldiers could do something more effective.
It would seem that a decisive blow ought to be
struck against the raiders within the next twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>This will make clear why after having retreated
part way to the fort, Decker halted, unwilling to
yield what he considered an advantageous position.</p>

<p>But, admitting all this, the three were in a situation
of extreme delicacy and peril. The Apaches
had drawn off from pursuit, but, at most, were not
far off. They had but to advance somewhat further
along the line they had been pursuing to come upon
the three horsemen, who had no means of concealing
themselves. The cunning and ingenuity already
displayed by Geronimo’s men made it seem folly
for Decker and his companions to believe they
could avoid being outwitted.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the officer resolved to hold his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
ground, or rather not to continue his flight, and
Maurice Freeman was as earnest in the same purpose
as he. The all-powerful motive with the elder,
however, will be understood, for he was really
fighting for the sake of those that were dearer to
him than his own life.</p>

<p>On these scouting excursions the lieutenant
always carried a few rations, so, while they waited
for night to close round them, the three partook of
food. When that was finished it was growing
dark.</p>

<p>Pointing his Winchester toward the sky, the
lieutenant discharged it twice in quick succession,
following with a third report at a longer interval.</p>

<p>“That is a signal to whoever of the boys may
hear it,” he explained to Freeman.</p>

<p>“And means what?”</p>

<p>“That I have located the hostiles and my friends
must join me with the least possible delay.”</p>

<p>“How will you know whether it is heard?”</p>

<p>“I will receive the same answer. The whole
thing is understood by every one who left the post—halloo!
do you hear that?”</p>

<p>The faint but distinct report of a rifle sounded
in the distance, and all three listened for the sounds
needed to complete the signal, but to their disappointment
there was none.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the lieutenant, “since Geronimo
may take it into his head to renew his acquaintance
with us, it is best to call upon Mendez here to help
us out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“The very suggestion I was about to make; how
will he do it?”</p>

<p>Mendez and Lieutenant Decker had scouted so
much together that they were familiar with each
other’s signals, and no preliminary rehearsal, therefore,
was necessary.</p>

<p>“The captain and I will go back to the stream,”
he explained to the Apache, “and follow the bank
some distance. When you have anything to communicate
you will know where to find us. At any
rate we will not be far off.”</p>

<p>“Provided nothing unexpected happens,” Freeman
thought best to add.</p>

<p>The scout was a man of few words and only said
“Huh!” to signify that he understood everything.
Then, without more ado, he turned the head of his
horse westward and rode off in the darkness.</p>

<p>“That brave fellow takes his life into his hands,”
remarked the lieutenant; “he knows he would
receive scant mercy if Geronimo or any of his band
got hold of him.”</p>

<p>“Wherein would he differ from us?” questioned
Freeman.</p>

<p>“In no respect, so far as final results are concerned,
but they would punish him frightfully, for
it is human nature to detest a renegade, as he and
Cemuri are considered.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it makes him more or less
useful, but it seems to me he must be handicapped
in his movements.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t appear to be; I think if Mendez or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Cemuri should become convinced that there was no
possible escape from capture he would shoot himself.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” said Freeman.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t, for as long as there’s life there’s
hope.”</p>

<p>“I meant when all hope is gone.”</p>

<p>“We may as well make our change of base.”</p>

<p>Side by side the friends rode to the left of the
course they had been following, until they struck
the shore of the stream already alluded to. It
seemed broader and shallower than below, but it
was a winding current through the sand, which
licked a great deal of water. The banks were so
low and flat that a slight rise of the creek would
cause it to overflow on both sides. No trees or
undergrowth being in the neighborhood, the same
difficulty of concealment remained.</p>

<p>When the full moon should rise in the unclouded
sky objects would be discernible for a long way in
every direction. While in some respects this might
not be desirable, the two looked upon it as an advantage,
since by diligence and watchfulness, they
ought to discover the approach of an enemy, no
matter how stealthily made, or from what point it
came.</p>

<p>It was a cause for self-gratulation that both were
so well mounted that none of their enemies could
overtake them in a fair contest of speed.</p>

<p>“It strikes me that as the moon will not show
itself for nearly an hour we may as well dismount. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
have been in the saddle so continuously to-day that
the change will be as grateful to me as to my
horse.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t strike me as the wisest thing to do,”
replied Freeman, “though I don’t know that it increases
our danger. I will not dismount, since I
have ridden less than you. You won’t leave your
horse?”</p>

<p>“No, though he knows my call so well he would
come to me at once.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant walked slowly with his steed along
the bank of the stream, for it seemed wiser to shift
their position, even if slightly, so as to prevent the
guarded approach of their enemies.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether any of them are in the neighborhood,”
he remarked, as they came to a halt
again; “I don’t see how they can be, but there’s
no saying what mischief they are up to. Listen!”</p>

<p>The two were motionless and used their eyes and
ears as best they could. In the gloom it was barely
possible to distinguish the opposite shore, only a
few rods distant, while darkness walled them in on
every hand.</p>

<p>The only sound that reached their ears was the
soft flow of the stream, barely distinguishable in
the profound stillness. Once they fancied they
heard the report of another gun, but, if so, it was so
distant it could not be identified.</p>

<p>One distressing question pressed upon Maurice
Freeman. Ought he to remain in this lonely place
or return to his home a number of miles distant? His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
family would not be disturbed over his absence, for he
had occasionally stayed at the fort over night and had
been absent longer at Prescott or Phœnix, but at
such times everything was so quiet that there was
no ground for alarm.</p>

<p>He reflected that his wife knew nothing of the
threatened raid of the Apaches, unless it had come
to her after his departure from home that morning.
Consequently, in the event of the hostiles
making a dash into that section, she would be
wholly unprepared against surprise.</p>

<p>Freeman and his friend Murray had taken an
active part in chastising a party of Apaches some
months before, most of them being killed, and he
suspected that revenge might be a factor in inspiring
this advance of Geronimo eastward. If such were
the fact, nothing was easier than for him and his
warriors to push on during the darkness, wreak
their vengeance and get away before the sun
rose.</p>

<p>The question, put in another form, was whether he
and Lieutenant Decker were accomplishing any
good purpose by thus lingering in the neighborhood
with a view of watching and possibly checking the
movements of the hostiles. If the latter were bent
on raiding further eastwards they could make a
detour which would carry them to the point they
had in view without the knowledge of the two men,
or of Mendez, who had gone forward to spy out
their actions.</p>

<p>The veteran was loath to leave his comrade, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
this hesitation was due to the uncertainty whether
it was wiser to do so than to remain.</p>

<p>He was on the point of expressing his misgivings,
when a low, soft whistle sounded on the still night
air.</p>

<p>“Sh!” whispered the lieutenant, “that’s Mendez!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">MAROZ AND CEBALLOS.</span></h2>

<p>The faint signal had only the breadth of the stream
to cross and was heard by the two men.</p>

<p>“It is Mendez,” repeated Decker in a whisper;
“he brings important news.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure it is he?” was the guarded inquiry
of Freeman, whose longer residence in that section
of the Union and greater experience with the wily
Apaches made him distrustful. The events of the
preceding few hours especially warned him that it
was impossible to use too much caution in dealing
with their enemies.</p>

<p>“I am as sure as one can well be,” said the officer,
who, it will be remembered, was not on his horse
but standing beside him.</p>

<p>“If it be he why does he not come to us? The
stream is not deep.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he expects us to join him—sh!”</p>

<p>The call which had caught their attention a few
minutes before was heard again.</p>

<p>“It will be the height of folly to attempt to
reach the other bank while this uncertainty exists,”
said Freeman; “I shall not do it.”</p>

<p>“Withdraw a short distance and wait for me.”</p>

<p>“Remember that those people have wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
keen eyes, and they may be able to distinguish us
when we cannot see them. It is better for both to
withdraw.”</p>

<p>“I will soon follow you if there’s anything
suspicious.”</p>

<p>Freeman walked his horse a hundred feet from
the stream, holding the bridle of the other animal
as he did so. The lieutenant remained by the
water’s edge, where, instead of keeping his standing
posture, he knelt down on one knee, a position which
lessened his chance of being observed by any foe on
the other side.</p>

<p>Peering intently in the darkness, he was able to
make out the shadowy figure of two and possibly
three men standing motionless in the gloom, the view
being so faint that at first he doubted whether he
saw anything at all.</p>

<p>For the first time Decker made a cautious response
to the signal, the same that had been
employed by him and the White Mountain scout in
previous instances of peril. Again it came across
the water to him, and, but for the suspicious circumstances,
he would have staked everything on its
being emitted by the dusky lips of his friend.</p>

<p>“If it be an enemy,” he reflected, “I would give
much to know where he got the call, but Mendez
had no companions when he left us, and certainly
there is more than one man standing on the other
shore.”</p>

<p>Nature now came to the help of the lieutenant.
The full moon was near the horizon, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
directly behind the opposite bank, and the slight
illumination it flung into the sky revealed the
forms of three persons so clearly that there could be
no mistake.</p>

<p>“It’s a cunning trick, but it will not work this
time, my good friends.”</p>

<p>Kneeling on one knee, the lieutenant took the
best aim he could at the group and let fly with one
charge from his Winchester.</p>

<p>This time the bullet sped true. One of the dusky
forms leaped into the air with a screech and fell
prostrate on his face, where he remained without
rising.</p>

<p>“Geronimo’s band is short one member,” was the
cool observation of Decker, who instantly changed
his position to a prone one, in which he hugged the
ground as closely as he could.</p>

<p>The precaution was not taken a second too soon.
Quickly recovering from their shock, the other two
Apaches fired at the point where they had seen the
flash of the rifle, the missiles whistling so close that
but for the act of the young man he must have been
struck.</p>

<p>Decker proved his nerve by holding his position
for several minutes. His hope was that his enemies
in their exasperation would dash into the stream to
cross to him, in which event he would have them
at his mercy, but they were too wily for that. Instead
of advancing, they retreated, evidently fearing
another shot from the one who had outwitted
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maurice Freeman was a prey to the
gravest anxiety. Much as he admired his companion,
he was almost certain that his rash bravery
would involve both in fatal disaster. He questioned
more and more the prudence of lingering in the
neighborhood, when it was certain the Apaches
were seeking their overthrow.</p>

<p>This uneasiness was intensified during the minute
following the discharge of the lieutenant’s rifle by
the proof that something was amiss. Both horses
flung up their heads and sniffed, looking not toward
the stream, but away from it.</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder we have escaped so long,” was the
impatient thought of Freeman; “now we are going
to catch it. Lieutenant,” he called, “come here at
once.”</p>

<p>Decker heard the voice, but a moment before it
reached him he had begun stealing from the stream,
holding his crouching posture until beyond range of
the sharpest-eyed warrior. He was within a rod or
two of the horses, when called to, and vaulted
instantly into the saddle.</p>

<p>“What is it, captain? Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“The action of the animals shows that danger
threatens, and in my opinion——”</p>

<p>“Sh?”</p>

<p>At the same instant the forms of two horsemen
loomed to sight on the right. They came forward
as silently as shadows, acting as if they saw nothing
of the others, or, seeing them, counted them as
naught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Halt!” commanded the lieutenant, “or I fire!”
a proceeding which would have taken place had
he not suspected the identity of the two.</p>

<p>“Huh! Maroz—Ceballos!” replied one of the
Apaches, without checking his animal.</p>

<p>“They are friends,” remarked the officer; “they
belong to the reservation and probably have been
at the fort.”</p>

<p>“I know them,” remarked Freeman, “but do not
include myself among their admirers.”</p>

<p>As Decker had remarked, Maroz and Ceballos
were two Apaches who were frequently seen at
Fort Reno. Two years before they were among
Geronimo’s most ferocious followers, but, for
most of the time since, had claimed to be, and indeed
had conducted themselves like good Indians. Both
were addicted to the use of “tiswin,” that decoction
of fermented corn, which is amazingly quick to inflame
the evil passions of an Indian to the highest
degree.</p>

<p>Despite the professions of these two bucks, and
the fact that nothing wrong was known against
them, they had not the confidence of the colonel
nor of most of the soldiers at the fort.</p>

<p>It will be understood, therefore, that neither
Lieutenant Decker nor Maurice Freeman felt that
degree of relief which would have been theirs had
they known of a certainty that they were joined by
two friends, for what can be more trying than the
company of those whom we distrust amid the
gravest possible peril?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Having announced themselves, Maroz and Ceballos
immediately joined the two horsemen, who treated
them as if certain they were friends.</p>

<p>“Why are you here?” asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Geronimo somewhere,” replied Maroz, speaking
for himself and his companion; “come with warrior—he
burn ranch—kill white folks—white folks
brothers of Maroz and Ceballos—dey help brothers.”</p>

<p>It was in the mind of Freeman to interpose with
the question as to how these two had learned of the
presence of the Apache leader, when until a few
hours before it was unknown to the white scouts,
but it would have been unwise at this point to let
the two know they were not fully trusted.</p>

<p>“Where are our men?” asked Decker; “I have
signaled but hear nothing of them; they ought not
to be many miles away.”</p>

<p>“Maroz and Ceballos don’t know—dey somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if they were; nothing is
more likely, but I would be glad if we could find the
precise spot.”</p>

<p>It was evident the new arrivals were disappointed
at not seeing some one else with the horsemen. It
was Maroz who asked:</p>

<p>“Where Mendez—where Cemuri?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker thought the situation warranted
a little deception on his part.</p>

<p>“They are watching Geronimo and the rest;
they may slay the chief before they come back to us.”</p>

<p>“Chief bad Injun—he kill much white folks—he
dog—help kill him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>This expression would have been comforting
could the hearers have believed it honest, for it
would have expressed their own sentiments.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” replied both, nodding their heads, for
the moon having risen meanwhile, their faces were
seen quite plainly.</p>

<p>“Well, all you have to do is to set about it.
Some of the hostiles are on the other side of the
stream and some are off yonder to the westward.
Slip in among them and shoot all you can.”</p>

<p>It was evident this was not the part the two
wished to play.</p>

<p>“We stay wid brother—we help him fight.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t; we don’t want you; you can do
no good here; we have sent Mendez and Cemuri
away; you must go, too.”</p>

<p>The officer was so peremptory that the Apaches
did not question him further. They glanced at each
other, then, without speaking, set off with their
ponies on a walk toward the stream now in plain
sight.</p>

<p>To the surprise of Decker and Freeman, they
drove their horses into the water and rode directly
to the other side. Near the middle the animals
sank to their flanks, but at no point were they
forced to swim. Emerging they continued straight
away until they faded from view.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it was wise to send them
off in that style,” remarked the lieutenant, “but I
don’t wish their company, even if they do claim to
be friends.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">MENDEZ, THE SCOUT.</span></h2>

<p>When Mendez, the White Mountain Apache, left
the company of Lieutenant Decker and Maurice
Freeman he fully comprehended the perilous
mission he had undertaken.</p>

<p>He had set out to learn and if possible help check
the scheme of Geronimo and his strong party, who
were pushing eastward toward the more fertile and
better settled Sutra Valley, with the purpose of
spreading fire, destruction and death wherever the
opportunity offered. What could this single scout
do to affect or hinder such a purpose?</p>

<p>Mendez dare not enter the camp of the hostiles,
under the pretense of being a friend of the raiders.
Geronimo and probably all his warriors knew the
one that had done them so much injury, and if
Mendez really wished to cast his lot with them, his
allegiance would not be accepted. His offensive
work would not admit of condonation.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker spoke the truth when he said
that his faithful scout would never allow himself to
be taken prisoner. He always kept one chamber of
his revolver filled for that emergency, which, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
would have to be desperate, before he would
apply the weapon to its last use.</p>

<p>The theory upon which the sagacious Mendez
acted was that Geronimo’s plan was to sweep from
his path the little company in his immediate front
before carrying out his original scheme. He
believed that these four were the only ones who had
divined his purpose. If, therefore, they were
“wiped out,” he could complete his terrific raid
before an adequate force could rally in his front
or cut him off. The destruction of the little party,
therefore, was the present design of the invaders.</p>

<p>If the scout was right in his surmise, Lieutenant
Decker had but to despatch Mendez in the opposite
direction, the same that the wounded Cemuri had
followed, in order to bring speedy help. Such
would have been the plan of the dusky scout, but he
was a man of silence, and made no attempt to gainsay
his commanding officer, no matter how much his
plans might conflict with his own judgment.</p>

<p>It should be said that Lieutenant Decker had
partly followed the course which Mendez preferred,
in that he had sent Cemuri off, not only to the fort,
but with instructions to find if possible the rest of
the cavalrymen or scouts who were abroad, and
acquaint them with the situation. Should he succeed
nearly all that was possible would be accomplished,
but the scout feared the severity of his comrade’s
wound would interfere with his usefulness.</p>

<p>However, dismissing all this from his mind, he set
to work to carry out the delicate task before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The first step was to locate the invaders, who
were not likely to separate at this stage of the proceedings,
and here Mendez followed a theory of his
own.</p>

<p>He believed the Apaches were not far off and
that they would steal forward in the hope of outwitting
and overcoming the white men. Nothing
was clearer than that the scout was at great disadvantage
so long as he remained on his horse. He
would be not only more conspicuous than on foot,
but would be stopped from using the remarkable
skill with which nature and long training had
equipped him. He, therefore, made a wide circuit
on the sandy plain to the left, until certain he was
beyond sight of any foe. Then he slipped to the
ground.</p>

<p>His well-trained animal would not wander from
the spot where he was left, and his owner was certain
to find him near it, always provided no one
else interfered with him. He patted his neck and
allowed the intelligent creature to rub his nose
against his shoulder. They understood each other.</p>

<p>Mendez now started to return over his own tracks,
bearing slightly to the eastward, until he approached
the stream. Then he paused.</p>

<p>The moon had not yet risen, but he knew it would
soon appear, when still greater caution would be
necessary in his movements. Stooping low he
applied his ear to the earth, but heard nothing.</p>

<p>Bending low and stepping slowly—an easy thing
to do on the sand—he pressed on until he reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the edge of the narrow, smoothly flowing stream.
There he stood motionless for several minutes,
debating whether to cross the creek or to push his
reconnaissance where he was.</p>

<p>Standing thus, he heard a noise which, though
faint, was easily identified. It was the whinny of
a horse and it came from some point on the opposite
bank. Geronimo and his band were there and he
determined to cross to them.</p>

<p>The peculiar noise was not directly opposite, but
somewhat to the right, that is, nearer to where he
had left his friends. Nevertheless, the scout moved
further down the stream before stepping into the
water. He suspected it was sufficiently shallow to
be forded, but was prepared to swim if need be.
He held his Winchester above his head, stepping
carefully into the current, which near the middle
reached above his waist. From that point the
depth decreased and he finally emerged, having
waded all the way. He was now on the same side
with the hostiles.</p>

<p>If detected, his situation was tenfold more
dangerous than before, and more than likely that
reserve shot in his revolver would be called upon.
The hostiles could easily run him down with their
horses and a plunge into the stream would not save
him.</p>

<p>In order to hide his movements he sank upon his
hands and knees and began creeping toward the
spot whence came the horse’s neigh. A few rods
were passed in this manner, when he caught sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of that for which he was searching. A group of
horsemen were dimly outlined against the sky.</p>

<p>So far as he could determine, there were at least
a dozen. No doubt the entire band had come together
and were holding a consultation as to what
course they should follow.</p>

<p>It would have been a most desirable thing could
he have approached near enough to overhear their
conversation, but that was impossible. He was
certain to be discovered by the animals, if not the
riders, and detection meant death.</p>

<p>He heard the murmur of their voices, but no syllable
that could be comprehended reached the
crouching figure in the sand.</p>

<p>Suppose they should turn their horses and ride
toward him! He could only make a break for the
stream and strive desperately for the other shore—a
feat which it may be said was impossible of accomplishment,
but this was only one of the many
risks which a scout has to face when operating in
Arizona.</p>

<p>From among the group three warriors emerged on
foot. They did not advance toward the solitary
figure in the sand, but took a diagonal course to the
stream, whose bank they followed until hidden in
the gloom. Mendez did not leave or move, but
speculated as to the meaning of this singular
action.</p>

<p>While still wondering, he heard the signal which
Lieutenant Decker mistook for that of a friend.</p>

<p>Mendez was startled, for he recognized its perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
imitation of the call which he had used many times
when scouting with the officer. He wondered by what
means their enemies had obtained it, and concluded
that it was one of those accidental occurrences, such
as are seen when two ranchmen, widely separated,
fix upon the same brand for their cattle.</p>

<p>The fact caused uneasiness, for the scout feared
that it would mislead his friend, but nothing could
be done to avert so disastrous a blunder. The
officer must be left to his own shrewdness, which,
as the reader has learned, proved sufficient for his
protection.</p>

<p>Then came the rifle-shot and death cry of one of the
hostiles. There could be no misinterpretation of
that meaning, and the dusky scout smiled grimly as
he reflected that another of the many schemes of
the raiders had gone amiss.</p>

<p>If any doubt remained on that point, it was removed
a few minutes later, when two warriors were
descried returning, whereas three had left the group
a short time before. The one stricken down had
been allowed to lie where he fell.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Mendez became aware
of a discomforting fact: the moon was rising and
would soon shed a bright illumination over stream
and plain. If he remained where he was, discovery
was inevitable. He therefore began a cautious
withdrawal from the perilous neighborhood.</p>

<p>He adopted a curious artifice. Instead of facing
about and creeping away, he imitated the action of
Geronimo’s horse some hours before, when confronting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Lieutenant Decker. He backed toward the
stream, a course which enabled him to keep an eye
on his enemies in front.</p>

<p>He had passed half the distance, and was cautiously
retrograding, when he experienced a shock.
One of the mounted Apaches left the group and
rode toward him!</p>

<p>Mendez ceased his motion on the instant and
grasped his Winchester so as to aim and fire in a
twinkling. His purpose was, if discovered, to shoot
the buck from his pony, dash forward and capture
his horse, or if that was not feasible, make a break
to the stream and run for his own animal.</p>

<p>One of these desperate attempts assuredly would
have followed had the horseman kept the course
upon which he started, but he had gone only a
little way when he made an abrupt change and approached
the bank at a point almost as far removed
from the scout as was the band of raiders.</p>

<p>This was a vast relief, and all fear would have
departed but for the moon which was rapidly
climbing the sky and shedding an effulgence that
made it like daylight itself. Had the scout risen
to his feet he would have been detected at once.
He must continue prone and reach the stream in
that posture or not reach it at all.</p>

<p>But it looked as if that solitary horseman was
doomed to be his death after all; for, instead of
crossing the creek or remaining where he was, he
turned once more, and, as before, headed toward
Mendez, who, believing the critical moment had
come, braced himself for the struggle.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE EAVESDROPPER.</span></h2>

<p>It would be hard to explain the course of the
Apache horseman. It looked at first as if he had
been aware of the presence of the scout for some,
and was trifling with him, as a cat sometimes toys
with a mouse before crunching it in her jaws, but
the peculiar circumstances forbids this explanation.</p>

<p>Instead of riding directly over the prostrate
figure, the buck once more checked his animal,
while several rods distant. Mendez, who was
watching him intently, then perceived that instead
of looking in front of his pony, he was gazing
toward the further shore of the stream, as if interested
there. Possibly he had seen or heard something
which he did not understand.</p>

<p>The few seconds’ grace thus granted were
improved by the imperiled scout. Gently swaying
his body, limbs and hands, he groveled and burrowed
silently into the sand, until, with the exception of
his head, he was covered. The fine particles
reached even to his shoulders. Stretched thus,
perfectly motionless, an enemy might have passed
within arm’s length without observing him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>The dread of Mendez was not that the rider would
see him, nor indeed that the horse would observe
him, but that the keen scent of the animal would
bring the revelation. There are many situations—and
this was one of them—in which the nose of a
horse is more to be feared than the sagacity of his
rider.</p>

<p>Whatever the Apache was studying did not
engage his attention long. He spoke to his pony,
which turned to one side and walked toward the
waiting group.</p>

<p>In doing this he approached still closer to the
figure almost wholly hidden in the sand. It is not
probable that he saw it, but his keen sense of smell
apprised him that some man or animal was near.
He swerved suddenly to one side with a snort, and
skillful as was his rider, the movement was so
abrupt that he came within a hair of being unseated.
He spoke angrily to his animal, striking his heels so
sharply against his ribs that he galloped the few remaining
steps to the main company.</p>

<p>No narrower escape than that of Mendez can be
conceived. With all his acumen he hardly understood
why the buck failed to make an investigation.
Had he done so, discovery was absolutely certain.
It must have been that he reasoned that no such
cause as the real one could exist, so close to the other
horseman, and such belief on his part was one of
the most reasonable things in the world.</p>

<p>But be all this as it may, it was high time that
the scout effected a change of base. Wonderful as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
was the good fortune that had attended him thus
far, it could not continue indefinitely: disaster
impended.</p>

<p>It was not far to the stream which he was so anxious
to reach, and yet, despite the peril involved
in remaining where he was, he decided it was not
so dangerous as to try to leave the spot while
Geronimo and his men were so near. He was now
effectually hidden in the sand, for he drew more of
the particles about his head until little more than his
hair and eyes was visible.</p>

<p>The keen vision of the hostiles was likely to be
drawn to the spot if he resumed his backward
movement toward the water. It will be remembered,
too, that the banks of the stream were so low
and flat that they could give no concealment, and
the agitation that must follow his entrance into the
shallow creek was certain to catch the notice of his
enemies.</p>

<p>And so, on the whole, he did the best thing possible,
risky as it must be, by staying where he was.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the whole gamut of fear was to be
run by Mendez, who found himself in such peculiar
danger. The horsemen made a shift of position
which brought them several yards nearer the prostrate
figure, who would have been glad to sink himself
several feet under the ground had it been
possible.</p>

<p>But this supreme trial of his nerves brought its
consolation, for he was now able to hear and understand
nearly everything said by his enemies—an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
achievement which otherwise would have been
among the impossibilities.</p>

<p>A significant fact, immediately preceding this
eavesdropper episode, was the arrival of Maroz and
Ceballos, who, as will be remembered, had been
sent away by Lieutenant Decker. From his curious
hiding-place Mendez recognized both, as they rode
up in the bright moonlight and joined the group as
if they were friends who expected their coming.</p>

<p>It will be more intelligible if we give a liberal interpretation
of the conversation between Geronimo
and the two arrivals.</p>

<p>“I am glad to look upon the face of my brothers,”
said the leader, by way of greeting; “I knew you
would hasten to join us.”</p>

<p>“We came as soon as we could; but the soldiers
watch us closely; they distrust us, though we have
done all we could to make them think us friends.”</p>

<p>To this remark by Maroz, Ceballos added:</p>

<p>“We are eager to give the great Geronimo all the
help we can.”</p>

<p>“Where are the soldiers?” was the pertinent
query of the chief.</p>

<p>“We are not sure; they were a few miles to the
east, near the Sutra Valley.”</p>

<p>“Do they know of our coming?”</p>

<p>“They cannot, but others do.”</p>

<p>“Who are the others?”</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Decker, the man Freeman with him,
and Mendez and Cemuri, the traitors.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“The white men are on the other side of the
stream; they killed one of your warriors, as I have
learned; Mendez and Cemuri have left them to
watch the movements of yourself and warriors.”</p>

<p>“I know the renegades are with the two white
men; I would give much could I lay hands on them,
but we fear them not; it is the horsemen whom we
need to look for, for they are more numerous than
we.”</p>

<p>“If we move quickly we may strike and get away
before the soldiers know where we are,” was the
wise suggestion of Maroz.</p>

<p>“That we would do if we could learn where the
soldiers are; we must first know that.”</p>

<p>In this remark, the Apache leader revealed the
key of the whole situation. He was among the
most cunning of his people, and, while at times, he
assumed risks that were of the most reckless character,
it was not his rule to do so when they could
well be avoided. He knew that the alarm of his
approach had spread, through some means, despite
his swiftness of movement. The American cavalry
were scouting through the country for him, and he
had had too many brushes with those daring
troopers to seek another conflict, even if he did not
always run away from a fight.</p>

<p>The remark quoted raised the interesting question
in the mind of the eavesdropper hidden in the sand,
whether, if Geronimo became convinced that the
course to the ranches to the eastward was well
guarded, he would not turn back and postpone his
raid to a more propitious season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the occasion when Maroz and Ceballos,
had they been the friends of the whites that they
pretended to be, might have done inestimable service
by making the dreaded scourge believe that
such danger threatened him. Instead of taking this
course, however, the miscreants urged him to hasten
the blow he was meditating.</p>

<p>“If you stay here too long,” continued Maroz,
“the soldiers will know of a certainty that you are
coming.”</p>

<p>“But they will not know where we mean to go.”</p>

<p>“Mendez and Cemuri will warn them,” suggested
Maroz, who, it will be remembered, knew nothing
of the wounding of Cemuri.</p>

<p>“They shall not live to see the sun rise!”
exclaimed Geronimo, with his old-time fierceness;
“we shall slay them both; the white men with
them shall be killed; then we will turn to the southward,
strike our blow and be gone before the
soldiers can learn where we are.”</p>

<p>It will be conceded that Mendez was acquiring a
good deal of interesting information. The question
was whether he would be able to turn it to account
since his own position was more perilous than that
of any one else.</p>

<p>“Let Maroz and Ceballos go back to the white
men; let them be vigilant, and when the chance
comes kill them both!”</p>

<p>“That is what we meant to do,” was the prompt
avowal of Ceballos, “but they sent us away before
we had the chance; they told us to go to you, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to fight against you; if we go back they will believe
we are your friends and they will slay us.”</p>

<p>There was sense in this statement of the situation,
and the great Apache leader could not fail to
see it. If the two should return to Lieutenant
Decker, after being sent away, it could not fail to
throw them under suspicion, and more than likely
their lives would pay the forfeit.</p>

<p>But it was necessary that some one should get
nearer the two than any of the Apaches had succeeded
in doing, or else no further attention was to
be given to the little party, who kept so persistently
in the path of the raiders, or Geronimo must postpone
his raid, as has been stated, to a more convenient
season.</p>

<p>The chieftain decided upon the first expedient.
He spoke to one of his most trusted scouts and directed
him to cross the stream, and by some means
slay the obstructing white men. This was an elastic
order, permitting, as it did, the widest latitude as to
the means employed; but it was all Geronimo could
do, for nothing would have been more idle than for
him to give minute instructions, when he could have
no possible knowledge of the complications that
would arise.</p>

<p>He might have called on any member of his band
and the response would have been as prompt as in
the case of the veteran scout who now essayed a
task as dangerous as it was difficult.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">CAVARHO AND MENDEZ.</span></h2>

<p>The scout selected by Geronimo showed his
wisdom by dismounting and setting out on foot to
perform his delicate mission. Like Mendez, he did
not mean to handicap himself with the presence of
his horse.</p>

<p>In going to the stream he almost stepped upon
the White Mountain Apache, who, fortunately for
him, had about buried himself in the sand, but with
all his astonishing skill, the hostile saw not the object
which could not have escaped his vision had he
once looked down to the earth, instead of keeping
his eyes fixed on the silently flowing stream and the
clearly defined bank beyond.</p>

<p>Mendez had certainly gone through his share of
trying danger. He had learned all that it was necessary
to know and much more than he expected to
learn, and his one desire now was to get back to his
friends. A grim warrior had started to seek their
lives, and, knowing his own race as he did, Mendez
feared the issue.</p>

<p>The moon had climbed so high in the heavens and
its light was so powerful that the scout not only
dared not approach the creek, but was afraid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
change his position or fling off any part of the
blanket of sand that had served so well to conceal
him. He must stay where he was until Geronimo
and his band moved away.</p>

<p>Luckily for the scout his suspense was soon relieved.
Suddenly the horsemen were in motion,
and, approaching the stream, followed its bank until
out of sight to the eastward.</p>

<p>This was the chance for which Mendez was waiting
with a feeling akin to impatience. Like a
sleeper roused from slumber, he shook himself free
from the rattling particles, and, rising to his feet,
skurried to the water’s edge, at the point where he
had emerged. A quick glance showed no one in
sight, and stepping into the current he made his way
to the other shore without incident.</p>

<p>His object now was to rejoin his friends as soon
as he could, impart the important tidings he had
gained, and help them guard against the treacherous
attempt that was sure to be made against their
lives.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker had told him where to seek
himself and Freeman. They might have shifted
their position, but not far. He recalled the point
whence the fatal shot had been fired into the group
of three Apaches, and turned his footsteps thither.</p>

<p>It was destined to be a night of adventure to the
daring scout, for while he was making his way
along shore, two horsemen suddenly loomed to view.
They were on the other side of the stream, however,
and he might have taken them for his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
had the light been less powerful. As it was, the
first glance showed them to be hostiles.</p>

<p>It will be understood that in one respect Mendez
held an immense advantage over them, for he knew
they were enemies, while they took him for a friend—a
natural mistake, since he belonged to their own
race, and his attire was similar to that of many of
the tribe.</p>

<p>Another incident contributed to the blunder:
their own scout had crossed but a few minutes
before. He was on foot, and in height and general
appearance resembled Mendez, while the moonlight
was just faint enough to exclude a close scrutiny.</p>

<p>The distance between the two was so slight that
it was easy to understand each other by using an
ordinary conversational tone.</p>

<p>“Cavarho,” said one of the horsemen, using the
name of the supposed scout, “why do you seek the
white men by the side of the stream?”</p>

<p>“Was it not from this side that they slew one of
our bravest men?” asked Mendez in turn.</p>

<p>“True, but not from that spot.”</p>

<p>“It is further up the bank and I am making my
way there.”</p>

<p>“But in the strong light of the moon they will
see you, Cavarho.”</p>

<p>“No sooner than they will see you on your
horses.”</p>

<p>“We shall watch for them.”</p>

<p>“And I will do the same.”</p>

<p>“Cavarho is our best scout,” was the complimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
remark of the horseman who had done the talking
for himself and companion.</p>

<p>And as if nothing more remained to be said, the
two wheeled their ponies and rode off, taking a
course that led away from the stream, as if in
respect to the warning their supposed friend had
given.</p>

<p>Mendez silently brought his rifle to his shoulder.
He could not have asked a better target and he was
certain of bringing down one if not both of them.
He made his aim true and then—lowered his weapon
without firing.</p>

<p>It is not often that an Apache is inspired by anything
of a chivalrous nature, but it was so in
this instance. Had the horsemen been facing
him, probably Mendez would have discharged
his Winchester, but with their backs toward him,
and without a suspicion of their danger, even his
soul rebelled. He allowed them to ride beyond
range, and never did they know how close they
trod the verge of death.</p>

<p>The scout resumed his guarded advance along the
stream and concluded that he was in the neighborhood
of his friends. He halted and looked around,
but saw nothing of them. As far as the eye could
reach, which in the clear atmosphere was further
than would be supposed, the white sand stretched,
with the winding stream agleam in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Mendez was on the point of emitting the signal,
when once more the whinny of a horse sounded on
the still night air. It startled him more than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
sound he had heard that night, for it was from his
own pony. Its direction left no doubt of that.</p>

<p>The conviction flashed upon him that the hostile
who had preceded him in crossing the stream had
come upon his horse and was probably trying to
make off with him. The whole nature of Mendez
flamed up at the outrage. He forgot everything
for the moment and set out to punish the criminal
and prevent the success of his daring purpose.</p>

<p>But intense as was his anger, the scout did not
forget the situation. He was about to confront one
of the most daring and skillful of his own race, who
was eager to make him bite the dust.</p>

<p>The suspicion of Mendez was correct. Cavarho,
after crossing the stream, had gone inland and
away from the shore, instead of turning to the left,
which would have taken him near the spot where
Lieutenant Decker and Maurice Freeman were
awaiting the return of Mendez and the development
of events. This course led him almost in a straight
line to where the pony of the friendly scout was
also awaiting the coming of his master.</p>

<p>Cavarho showed his quickness of perception by
discovering the animal before the latter detected
him. The presence of the pony in this lonely place
suggested the proximity of his master, and the scout
did considerable maneuvering before venturing
nearer. A complete circuit of the animal, however,
showed that nothing of that nature was to be feared.
Probably Cavarho suspected the true state of the
case, though of course nothing can be said with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
certainty on that point. At any rate, having
learned that no person beside himself was in the
immediate vicinity, he walked toward the animal
with the intention of making a prisoner of him.</p>

<p>Before this, the horse had perceived him and
stood with head erect, studying the figure as it
drew near. His intelligence quickly told him it was
not his master, but a number of soothing expressions
quieted his fears, and he suffered the stranger
to come quite close before taking the alarm.</p>

<p>Cavarho advanced with a slow and almost imperceptible
movement, murmuring gently in his own
tongue, while the beast hesitated whether to permit
more familiarity or to bound away.</p>

<p>He decided upon the latter, but deferred the
matter just a second too long. In the act of wheeling,
the Apache made a catlike leap and grasped
his forelock, holding him with a grip which could
not be shaken off. The pony uttered an angry
whinny and struggled to free himself, but, unable
to do so, quickly gave up the effort.</p>

<p>It was rarely that Mendez used a saddle. He generally
preferred to ride bareback, with a rope or a
strap for a halter, his voice being generally sufficient
for all directions. The fact that he had no bridle
or saddle must have given Cavarho an inkling of
the truth and told him that the horse belonged
either to Mendez or Cemuri. Be that as it may, he
flung himself upon his back and became for the
moment master of the situation.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that a faint, peculiar cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
struck the ear of the horse, which recognized it as
the call of his master. Instantly he dashed in the
direction whence it came. A dozen Cavarhos
would not have been sufficient to restrain or turn
the steed aside from his purpose.</p>

<p>But the acumen of the strange rider told him the
meaning of all this, and he leaped to the ground in
a twinkling. As he did so, he saw the figure of the
enraged Mendez bearing down upon him.</p>

<p>There was little time for preparation and none for
the peculiar strategy in which both were experts.
Each was armed with a Winchester, and almost
simultaneously they were brought to a level.</p>

<p>Mendez was quick enough to anticipate Cavarho.</p>

<p>The pleased horse, happy to recognize his own
master, rubbed his nose against his cheek, while
Mendez petted and uttered many an endearing
expression. It would have been a sore grief to the
scout to lose his precious steed, that had been his
faithful companion in many a perilous experience.</p>

<p>Mendez was on his back the next instant, and
keeping in mind the points of the compass, he
readily guided him toward the spot where he expected
to find his friends.</p>

<p>Nor was he disappointed. Lieutenant Decker and
Captain Freeman were on the alert, and, when the
familiar whistle of the scout pierced the still air,
there was so little doubt in the mind of the young
officer that he answered it without hesitation.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Mendez emerged from the
gloom, and, riding forward a brief space, the two
saluted the other.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A CALL AND A REPLY.</span></h2>

<p>Mendez brought momentous tidings indeed. Addicted
as he was to silence and with no disposition
to talk, he had to do considerable of it now. His
imperfect knowledge of English made it necessary
for his friends to ask many questions, but it did not
take them long to learn all that he had gathered and
which has been told in its proper place to the
reader.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said the lieutenant, “you have been
uneasy all along because I insisted upon our staying
here. I could see that you were on the point of
making a break for your home; are you sorry now
that you did not?”</p>

<p>“No; I will admit that I served my family as
well and perhaps better by staying here, but it was
hard to believe so at the time.”</p>

<p>“It is rather curious, and I was doubtful myself
more than once.”</p>

<p>“Geronimo has the reputation of being a shrewd
leader, but I can’t see wherein he shows it by staying
in this part of the country, when he could make
a dash into the Sutra Valley and be far on his return
before we knew anything about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is not to be supposed that he holds us in any
fear, but it is the other scouts that he knows are
somewhere in the neighborhood. He doesn’t wish
to move until he learns where they are.”</p>

<p>“But he has done so many times before.”</p>

<p>“Some time when we hold him a prisoner (if we
can hold him long enough), we’ll ask him for an explanation.
It’s sufficient for us to know that we
have served our friends well by keeping him in
check. Every hour counts, too, in our favor. He
has lost two of his best men and we are without a
scratch.”</p>

<p>“True, for the present,” remarked Freeman, looking
around in the moonlight, as if he expected to
discover some of their foes trying to steal upon
them.</p>

<p>“There’s one beauty of the situation which I
don’t think you appreciate, captain.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Geronimo sent out his best scouts to shoot us,
or at least to locate us and make it easy for the
others to do the job. The chief will wait a long
time before he begins to suspect what has befallen
that same scout.”</p>

<p>“That was a marvelous exploit of Mendez,” said
Freeman warmly; “I never saw a man who was his
superior.”</p>

<p>“He has no superior.”</p>

<p>The subject of these compliments sat motionless
on his horse, his black eyes glancing in every direction,
and on the alert as he always was. He heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and understood every word, but nothing in his
manner showed it.</p>

<p>“And yet to my mind his disposal of the scout
was not the equal of his exploit in remaining in
hiding so near the band that he overheard every
word said by Geronimo and his men; that was a
wonderful thing.”</p>

<p>“It was indeed. He secured just the news we
needed and which gives us a perfect knowledge of
the old fellow’s plans.”</p>

<p>“How long do you think he will await the return
of his scout?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying, the lieutenant turned the
question over to Mendez. Perhaps the latter was
impatient with the continued complimentary allusions
to himself, for without looking at either of the
men, he answered:</p>

<p>“Dunno.”</p>

<p>“Nor does any one else. If I were to give a
guess, however, I should say two hours at least, and
perhaps longer. Let me see.”</p>

<p>The officer took out his watch, the face of which
could be plainly seen in the bright light.</p>

<p>“It is exactly ten o’clock. If I am right in my
surmise, he will make no move before midnight.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t right—you wrong,” interjected Mendez, to
the amusement of his companions.</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you say so before? Now,
Mendez, give <em>your</em> guess.”</p>

<p>“Wait one—two—three hours.”</p>

<p>“That’s better, for it takes us beyond midnight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
I shouldn’t wonder, if Geronimo waits that long,
that he will not conclude it best to give up his
raid.”</p>

<p>This was thrown out as a feeler, and both, with a
smile, awaited the comment of Mendez, but he made
none. He seemed to think he had imparted sufficient
information.</p>

<p>“While we are speculating,” continued the lieutenant,
“it seems to me that when one o’clock
arrives, the chief will send some other scout, or perhaps
two or three of them, to investigate—all of
which will consume time, so that the night will be
well gone before he makes a move. Am I right,
Mendez?”</p>

<p>“Dunno.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant was in high spirits over their
success thus far and disposed to be facetious at the
expense of their grim companion.</p>

<p>“You made the same remark before, as preliminary
to a definite expression of your views; may I
hope that it will be the same in this instance?”</p>

<p>Perhaps the wording of this inquiry lifted it
above the comprehension of the Apache, for, withdrawing
his scrutiny of their surroundings for a
minute, he looked at the officer, and, in his contempt
for his badinage, forgot the respect due his rank.</p>

<p>“Huh! talk like big fool!”</p>

<p>This was too much for Freeman, who threw back
his head and laughed heartily, taking care that his
mirth should be as silent as possible. Mendez now
stared at him, and said with more scorn if possible
than before:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Huh! big fool!”</p>

<p>And then it was the lieutenant’s turn, who almost
fell from his saddle with merriment. The scout
surveyed the two alternately. He would have been
relieved to give expression to his feelings, but made
no attempt, possibly because he could not do them
justice. Instead, he turned his attention to their
surroundings, peering here, there and everywhere
with that birdlike restlessness which he always
showed when in a situation resembling the present.</p>

<p>The three horses were hungry, for none of them
had eaten anything since early in the day, but there
was no help for it. Fodder could not be obtained
in that section, where, as has been shown, the sandy
soil yielded comparatively nothing. They would do
well enough while water was to be had, even if
compelled to go twenty-fours longer without nourishment.
The ponies ridden by the raiding Apaches
often suffered for a longer period, and, during many
of the hard rides in the frightful summer months,
they could not obtain a mouthful of water for long
hours, while the raiders themselves underwent hardships
which few civilized people can stand.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker had a portion of his frugal
rations still in reserve, but since they had eaten not
long before, it was decided to keep the food until
morning.</p>

<p>A long, trying wait was before them, and he and
Freeman dismounted, the officer striking a match,
with which he lit a cigar, first giving one to Freeman,
who found much solace in smoking it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have been greatly depressed,” remarked the
latter, “since I learned of this impending raid until
now. My thoughts were with my wife and little
ones, and the relief is now so great to know that
they are not only safe, but that the danger is growing
less with every hour that I am in buoyant spirits.”</p>

<p>“The expression of Mendez’s opinion then does
not disturb you?”</p>

<p>“No; since you share with me his estimation.”</p>

<p>“His views in my case were made with less
emphasis.”</p>

<p>“But he was equally in earnest; if my title of
captain, which you are so fond of giving me, was as
real as your own, I suspect he would have exchanged
the compliments.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, but I forgive him in view of what he
has accomplished for the good of the cause.”</p>

<p>“Wait—me come back.”</p>

<p>The men suspected the scout of wishing to place
himself beyond range of their observations, for he
now rode his horse toward the stream, on the other
side of which it was believed the hostiles were still
awaiting events.</p>

<p>“I hope he is not offended,” remarked Freeman,
when their friend was beyond earshot.</p>

<p>“Offended! no; he doesn’t like to be complimented,
in which respect he differs from most folks.
I suspect we distract his vigilance and he wishes to
get away by himself, where he can do his duty
without interference.”</p>

<p>“And yet he apprehends no molestation from the
hostiles for several hours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“But lacks the guarantee that we will be let
alone even for a fraction of that time. He is one
of those wise fellows who take no chances. I
wonder,” added the lieutenant, suddenly shifting the
conversation, “how Cemuri made out.”</p>

<p>“I see no reason to doubt his speedy arrival at the
fort, but it is too soon to expect help from there.”</p>

<p>“I am hopeful that he came across some of the
soldiers before going that far.”</p>

<p>“He may have met Maroz and Ceballos.”</p>

<p>“It is possible, but he was as distrustful of them
as we, and would have avoided them.”</p>

<p>“He was well mounted, but those two scamps
are treacherous. They have proved it to the satisfaction
of Mendez, whose testimony ought to hang
them.”</p>

<p>“It ought to, but it won’t. He overheard enough
to show their disloyalty, but he did not see them
commit any overt act, and they would plead
that they were compelled to pretend a friendship to
the hostiles to save their lives.”</p>

<p>“It was fortunate that you sent them off so
promptly, for as long as they were in our company
there is no saying what evil they would work.
Lieutenant, why not repeat the signal you made
some time ago?”</p>

<p>“The suggestion is a good one. If it doesn’t
bring the boys it may add to Geronimo’s uneasiness.”</p>

<p>Again pointing his Winchester skyward, the young
officer discharged it as before—two shots in quick
succession, followed by a third at a longer interval.</p>

<p>And this time there was a reply!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE TROOPERS.</span></h2>

<p>Cemuri, the wounded scout, did his duty well.
Convinced that Lieutenant Decker did the right
thing in ordering him to return to Fort Reno, to
have his hurt looked after, he was as eager as ever
to befriend the gallant young officer and his companions,
thus deprived of his services.</p>

<p>The White Mountain Apache waited but a short
time after the disappearance of Maroz and Ceballos,
when he climbed into the saddle and headed his
pony for the fort. His suffering was great, but his
iron will mastered the weakness of his body, for
which he showed his contempt by striking his animal
into a gallop, which served to increase his pain.</p>

<p>A mile away he came directly upon six cavalrymen
who were out on a scout. Among them were
Armon Peyser, Budge Colgate and Jack Redfield,
who had campaigned for years in New Mexico and
Arizona and knew all there was to know of the cunning
and ferocity of Geronimo, Natchez and their
fierce followers.</p>

<p>Cemuri quickly told his story. He was able to
locate the raiders and direct the party to the spot
where the three scouts were doing all they could to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
hold them in check. Despite the pluck of the
friendly Apache, he could not hide his suffering, and
Peyser, in his sympathy, offered to send one of his
men with him to the post.</p>

<p>This proposition, made with the best of intentions,
was almost an insult to Cemuri. He refused it
point-blank, and, to prevent its repetition, galloped
away without so much as a farewell. None knew
better than he that he could not receive aid too
soon, but he would accept no guidance or assistance
from these friends.</p>

<p>“That’s good news of his,” said Peyser, as he and
his companions sat grouped together in the moonlight,
“for it means a fight.”</p>

<p>“But Geronimo has some twenty of his bucks with
him,” reminded Budge Colgate, “and to put matters
in a good shape, we ought to have more of the boys
with us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do it if we can, but, if they can’t be found
in time, we won’t be cheated out of our fun.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Jennings and the rest are far off,”
suggested Jack Redfield, who now made the signal
used by Lieutenant Decker, who was too far off to
hear the reports.</p>

<p>To their delight, the hail was instantly answered
from a point so near at hand that the three
instinctively turned their eyes to the south whence
it came.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, a ringing “Halloo!” sounded
through the stillness and a round dozen horsemen
loomed to view, coming at a swinging pace. In a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
twinkling, as may be said, eighteen well-mounted
and armed United States troopers gathered in the
middle of the sandy plain. Armon Peyser, as the
oldest campaigner and by virtue of his office as
sergeant, was leader, though when a junction
should be effected with Freeman and Decker, the
lieutenant of course would assume command.</p>

<p>A hurried consultation followed. It was nearly
five miles to the bend of the stream, where Cemuri
had left his friends, and Peyser began describing
the place, as well as he could, when Budge Colgate
interrupted him.</p>

<p>“I know the spot! We can ride there in a bee
line; lead on sergeant.”</p>

<p>And away they went, hardly drawing rein until
within a fourth of a mile of the stream. Knowing
they were near it, the party slackened their pace
and were cautiously advancing, with Colgate at the
head, when the signal of Lieutenant Decker reached
them.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the scout; “I knew it wasn’t
far off.”</p>

<p>As has been shown, the hail was promptly
answered and a second junction took place, with the
result that a round twenty horsemen were brought
together, all eager for a brush with the hostiles.
Mendez had not yet returned from his reconnaissance
upon which he ventured some time before. He
was not so far off, however, that he did not know
of the arrival of the reinforcements, and he was but
a few minutes behind them in reaching the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Being ready for the serious business now in hand,
the all-important requisite was to know the situation
of the foe whom they meant to strike. Mendez
had no information to give on that point, for when
he left his two friends he went only a short way.
His purpose was not so much to spy out the hostiles
as to prevent their spying out the two whites and
stealing a march upon them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker was as indisposed as any of
his companions to remain idle until the rising of the
sun. Accordingly the three best scouts, including
Mendez, were sent out to locate the raiders, if possible,
with a view of attacking them at the earliest
moment. In their absence, the troopers dismounted
and lolled about in the sand, some snatching a little
sleep, others smoking and talking in low tones,
while the sentinels, as a matter of course, were
placed at the proper points to guard against
surprise.</p>

<p>Martin, one of the white scouts, went up the
stream, Potter, another, took the opposite course,
while Mendez rode his pony to the other side. The
other two were also mounted, for it will be understood
that their duty differed from that of the
Apache scout, when he first went out. It was then
an object with him to steal as close as he could to
the raiders, with a view of learning their purposes,
and it has been shown how well he did his duty.</p>

<p>In the present instance, however, it was only necessary
to find out where the main body of hostiles
were. The instant that became known, the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
making the discovery would hasten back with the
information. If well mounted, he could do this
much more successfully than if on foot.</p>

<p>It was not to be supposed that the hostiles would
be on the alert against such an enterprise, and the
scouts undertaking it were hopeful of making their
discovery and getting back within an hour from the
time of their going forth.</p>

<p>The most dangerous proceeding, as it seemed, was
that of Mendez in crossing the stream, for the presumption
was that the enemies were on the other side.
If he should be seen, as was quite likely, when he
located the raiders he would have to make a desperate
ride for life. It would not do to dash into
the stream, for his progress would be so checked
that he would become the best of targets for his
enemies.</p>

<p>Recalling where he had last seen Geronimo and
his bucks, Mendez rode in that direction. He knew
he would not find them there, for his last glimpse
showed them leaving the spot, but he made his way
thither without detecting the first sign of them.</p>

<p>In the strong moonlight, the scout could readily
see the footprints of the horses, without leaning
over from the back of his own steed. The trail led
up the stream, keeping quite near it, and then, to the
surprise of the scout, it circled to the left and away
from the water.</p>

<p>He could not fathom the meaning of this, nor
indeed did he try to do so, for the special necessity
did not exist, but he kept to it, his horse advancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
slowly, while the rider peered into the gloom on
every hand. The situation became more critical
every moment.</p>

<p>The trail showed that the raiders were keeping
well together and their animals were walking.
Here and there diverging hoofprints indicated that
one or more of the horsemen had drawn off from
the main body, or else two separate trails crossed
each other.</p>

<p>The circle swept inward upon the plain, and by
and by turned backward, that is to the west. To
the astonishment of Mendez, it began approaching
the stream, as if the hostiles meant to recross it. If
this were the fact, Potter, who had gone down the
bank of the creek would probably be the first to
discover the Apaches.</p>

<p>The probability of this issue caused the dusky
scout uneasiness, for the raiders being on the same
side with the troopers were likely to locate them
before being observed, thus securing a perilous
advantage, to say nothing of the great danger in
which Potter would be placed, despite his skill and
experience.</p>

<p>Mendez was approaching the stream, whose
smooth surface gleamed in the moonlight, when his
steed quietly stopped. He made no sound, but
pricked his ears.</p>

<p>This was enough, for his owner knew what it
meant. An enemy was near. Less than a minute
was sufficient to place him. He was directly ahead,
and like Mendez was mounted, being probably one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of the hostile scouts that had been sent to the rear
to watch for just such attempts as were now making
against them.</p>

<p>The situation assumed the interesting phase of
two highly trained scouts maneuvering against each
other. Wonderful as was the skill of Mendez, it
did not surpass that of his enemy, whose horse was
also the equal of the one ridden by the other.</p>

<p>The pony of the scout had shown astonishing
quickness in detecting the presence of the other
equine, but at precisely the same moment the latter
warned his rider of the approach of the other.
Both halted and for a minute or more remained
motionless. Then Mendez made the curious discovery
that his foe was gradually fading from
sight.</p>

<p>There was no mystery in this vanishment, however,
which was in accord with natural laws. The
hostile had whirled his animal around with a quickness
which could not be noted at that distance, and
began walking him toward the stream, closely
watching at the same time the movements of the
foe thus thrown to the rear.</p>

<p>Instead of following, Mendez waited until the
other had passed out of his field of vision. Then he
turned abruptly to the left and rode to the edge of
the stream. There he and his animal again became
stationary.</p>

<p>The rider was listening and looking. The eyes
told him nothing, but a faint splashing noise, several
times repeated, came to him. He interpreted it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
meaning that the horseman whom he had seen was
crossing the creek.</p>

<p>This of itself was of little importance, but Mendez
accepted it as evidence that the whole band had
done the same thing some time before, and the
horseman was now on his way to rejoin them. So
convinced indeed was Mendez on this point that he
guided his animal carefully into the water and
forded the stream, without searching out the place
where Geronimo and his hostiles had also crossed.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">WAITING FOR DAYLIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>Having emerged from the stream, Mendez rode
down the bank, toward the ridge, where the hostiles
had been first seen during the day. It will be
remembered that he had now entered upon the
bailiwick of Potter, the scout, who was engaged
upon the same errand.</p>

<p>As before, the friendly Apache placed his main
reliance upon his pony, who knew as well as his rider
the delicate duty in hand.</p>

<p>The animal walked slowly, his hoofs sinking to
the fetlocks in the soft sand, while the senses of
both were at the highest point. To the surprise of
Mendez he passed a full half mile without observing
the slightest sign of his enemies. Then, as before,
his animal stopped of his own accord.</p>

<p>The keenest scrutiny of the front and on every
hand failed to show the cause of the abrupt stoppage
of the horse, but he must have had a cause,
for, as may be said, his action was controlled by an
instinct approaching reason.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed without the appearance of
anything to explain the situation, and then Mendez
gently pressed one heel against the ribs of the pony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
who resumed his walk, but stopped again after
taking a dozen steps.</p>

<p>Some of the Apache horses must have been less
trained than they should have been, for not one
but two or three neighed upon discovering another
of their species in their vicinity.</p>

<p>It was all sufficient; Mendez had located the band
and he now turned his animal’s head in the other
direction to report to Lieutenant Decker. At that
moment several Apache horsemen burst into sight,
dashing at full speed toward the scout, who, with a
word sent his own animal flying toward camp.</p>

<p>The race was short and furious. Mendez was the
better mounted and rapidly pulled away from his
pursuers, who sent several bullets whistling after
him and then drew off from the pursuit.</p>

<p>When convinced that the chase was over, Mendez
checked his speed and turned slightly to the right,
so as to draw away from the stream, which had
been followed most of the time. He was not far
from camp and haste was not necessary.</p>

<p>And again his horse made a discovery. He did
not stop but slackened his pace, with ears erect and
head turned to the right, toward the open plain.</p>

<p>The keen vision of the rider quickly saw the
cause. A dark object was discerned on the sand,
but was so indistinct that its nature could not be
learned without a nearer approach.</p>

<p>The first thought was that it might be one of the
hostiles, trying to steal upon the whites in this
characteristic fashion. Mendez held his rifle ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to fire and gently urged his horse to advance. He
seemed loath to obey, but did so, once more halting,
after advancing a few paces.</p>

<p>That which the scout saw was the figure of a man
prone and motionless in the sand. Studying him
for some time, no change of position could be perceived.
The pony was urged more sternly than
before. As if aware that it was useless to disregard
his master’s command, he snorted and then walked
straight to the figure, not stopping until his owner
checked him within twenty feet.</p>

<p>The form on the ground was that of Potter, the
scout. He was lying on his face and did not move
a muscle. There was good reason for this as was
shown by the feather-tipped point of an arrow
which projected from between his shoulders.</p>

<p>Mendez slipped from his steed and stooping over
rolled the body on its back. The scout had been
dead for some time, killed by an arrow driven with
such terrific force into his back that the tip showed
in front. While he was stealing upon his enemies
he must have been discovered by one of them,
without the knowledge of the scout. Although the
Apaches are experts in the use of firearms, they are
equally skillful in handling the bow and arrow,
which, because of their noiselessness, sometimes
serve their cruel purposes better than the more
common weapon. They have often slain a white
man within a few rods of his friends, without
awaking suspicion, the twang of the bowstring
being scarcely louder than a sudden puff of air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>With all his experience in scouting against those
people, the white man had met his death at last
through their superior cunning.</p>

<p>Mendez vaulted upon the back of his pony and a
few minutes later rejoined his friends. The horse
of Potter had arrived some time before, so that his
companions were prepared for the news. Almost
at the same moment, Martin came in with word
that he had been unable to learn anything, which,
in view of the fate of his comrade, was perhaps a
fortunate thing for him.</p>

<p>One fact was evident: the Apaches had been as
quick to detect the presence of the troopers as the
latter were to discover them. None of the sentinels
had observed any of the hostiles prowling in the
neighborhood, but there could be no doubt that one
or more of them had crept nigh enough to learn the
truth.</p>

<p>“They are a half mile or so away,” remarked
Lieutenant Decker to the leading scouts, whom he
was always glad to consult; “and what is best to
do?”</p>

<p>“If you will allow me,” remarked Freeman, “we
can do nothing but wait for daylight, for the reason
that it is impossible now to surprise them.”</p>

<p>“That is sensible,” commented Peyser, “they will
be looking for us, and, if we make an attack in the
moonlight, they will have the advantage.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant examined his watch. It was considerably
past midnight. He was ready to lead a
charge against the raiders, but it would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
unwise in view of what was already known. He
assented to wait until sunrise.</p>

<p>“But it is well to make a change of base,” he
said; “the Apaches, knowing we are here, will try
to gain a shot at us.”</p>

<p>Inasmuch as there was little choice of location,
the troopers took the singular course of riding out
on the plain to the spot where the body of Potter,
the scout, lay stretched in the sand. They could not
abandon it, the intention being to take it back to
the fort and give it Christian burial.</p>

<p>Men engaged upon such arduous work as the
troopers snatch sleep and rest as the opportunity
offers. The night was cool enough to make their
blankets comfortable, and they were spread on the
sand, while the hardy owners stretched out upon
them, sinking almost immediately into deep, restful
slumber. All the horses had been ridden hard and
the rest was grateful to them, even though they
suffered for food. Thus the scene was a curious one.
With the exception of three sentinels, placed at some
distance from camp, the entire company were
unconscious.</p>

<p>But it need not be said that they slept on their
arms, ready to leap to their feet and fight to the
death at the first alarm. They had done it many
a time before and always held themselves ready to
do it again.</p>

<p>The sentinel to the north and the one to the south
saw nothing to cause the slightest misgiving. They
were extremely vigilant, for each realized that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
own life, as well as the lives of his comrades might
be sacrificed by a moment’s forgetfulness. If an
Apache was permitted to steal nigh enough to launch
his deadly arrow, he would thus open the way for
a swift and deadly charge by his comrades.</p>

<p>Three times the guard placed between the camp
and stream was on the point of firing his gun, but
checked himself until his suspicion should become
certainty. A faint ripple of water drew his attention
to the creek, and he dimly saw a small dark
object floating on the water. At first it appeared
to be drifting with the current, but he fancied it
was gradually working to the shore nearer to him.</p>

<p>“I believe it is the head of one of them,” was his
thought; “as soon as he comes nigh enough I’ll let
drive.”</p>

<p>But after floating down stream a considerable
way, it disappeared. The sentinel was an intelligent
and alert fellow, who did not allow his scrutiny
to be diverted more than a moment from any
point of the compass within his field of vision. He
knew that one of the favorite tricks of the Apaches
was to draw the attention of their enemies to some
point while the real danger approached from the
other.</p>

<p>A half hour later the soldier on duty saw
precisely the same thing repeated. A small round
object drifted with the current, but, so far as he
could determine, it was working toward the further
bank; but, as in the former case, it remained in the
water until it passed from sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think I could hit it from here,” reflected the
sentinel, “but it may be a piece of wood or something
like that, and the boys need their rest so
much that it’s a pity to wake them without good
cause—well, I’ll be hanged!”</p>

<p>It was not in the water this time, but close to it
that the suspicious object now showed itself. It
looked as if the first one having effected a landing
at a point down stream was stealing up again, with
a view of approaching camp. To do this, it kept on
the very margin of the current, where the slight
depression of the sandy bank afforded a trifling protection,
though not enough wholly to conceal it.</p>

<p>“It’s one of them, dead sure,” muttered the
trooper, making ready to give him a proper reception;
“he can’t do any mischief until he comes
nearer, and if I don’t let the moonlight shine
through his noddle it will be because I’ve forgotten
how to fire a gun.”</p>

<p>But after all the chance for a test of his marksmanship
was denied the man who was so anxious to
pick off the miscreant. While carefully watching
and waiting until he could make his aim sure, the
object, whatever it was, vanished, nor did it appear
again.</p>

<p>The soldier could not know of a certainty the
explanation of this curious occurrence and asked the
opinion of Mendez the following morning. That
sagacious scout listened attentively to the story and
said in his abrupt way:</p>

<p>“Him ’Pache.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>But the few hours remaining of night passed
without further alarm, and men and animals secured
a much needed and refreshing rest. Dawn came at
last and all felt that the day was to prove a decisive
one.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN INTERRUPTED FLIGHT.</span></h2>

<p>The troopers wasted no time. No coffee was
boiled, for the means of kindling a fire was not at
command. He who has been on a laborious march
knows the meaning of such a deprivation. Rations
were hastily eaten and the horses drank from the
stream at hand and continued their fasting.</p>

<p>The body of the fallen scout was secured on the
back of his steed, which accompanied the scouting
party when it headed westward. The time for
serious work had come.</p>

<p>The Apaches could not ambush this daring band
of campaigners, riding hard through the open country,
with their eyes alert for every form of danger.</p>

<p>With no deviation the cavalrymen galloped to the
spot where Mendez had located their enemies the
previous night, but long before reaching the place
it was seen that the raiders were gone.</p>

<p>But whither? That was the question on every
tongue.</p>

<p>“I have a misgiving,” said Maurice Freeman to
Lieutenant Decker, “that when Geronimo learned
we were here, he made a detour and has passed over
into the valley after all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“I sympathize with you, captain, for you cannot
help feeling anxious about your family, but none of
the boys believe the thing probable.”</p>

<p>“Of course they would not make the raid with
the idea of coming back this way, but they could
turn southward toward the Apache Mountains and
escape.”</p>

<p>“Not without giving us a chance, which they
don’t mean to give,” was the remark of the young
officer, uttered with such confidence that it lessened
the uneasiness of the ranchman.</p>

<p>Sweeping over a slight elevation in front they
came in sight of the ridge behind which the raiders
were discovered on the preceding day. Mendez,
who as guide was riding slightly in advance, turned
his dusky face and looked at the lieutenant with an
odd half smile.</p>

<p>“What is it, old fellow?”</p>

<p>“’Pache dere!” was the thrilling response.</p>

<p>“It can’t be possible that they intend to make a
stand,” reflected Decker, bringing his glass to his
eyes; “that would be too much like honorable
warfare.”</p>

<p>There were several instruments in the party, but
none revealed the cause of the assertion made by
Mendez. No one, however, doubted its truth.</p>

<p>Regardless of any shots that might be fired from
the ridge, the troopers swept up the slope on the
<i lang="fr">qui vive</i> for the battle that seemed at hand.</p>

<p>But it would have been strange indeed had they
come face to face with the raiders, who would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
thus been forced to fight on something like equal
terms.</p>

<p>A mile away, however, to the westward, the
whole band was seen riding as if for their lives.
Geronimo and his men had no intention of meeting
a force that had a fair chance with them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker gave expression to his disappointment.</p>

<p>“We might have known it; they won’t fight.”</p>

<p>“But we can compel them,” insisted Armon
Peyser.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Run ’em down.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if we <em>could</em>, but what chance have we of
that?”</p>

<p>This question carried its own answer. Several
of the scouts, including the lieutenant himself, were
so well mounted that by pushing hard they might
have come up with some of the fugitives; but the
majority of the troopers could not do so. Their
horses were no fleeter than those ridden by the
Apaches. Besides, they were hungry and in need
of rest. The task was impossible.</p>

<p>Another peculiar recourse was at the command of
the fugitives. If they should find the pursuit growing
hot, they would separate into two or three parties,
these again breaking up, until perhaps every
warrior would be looking out for himself. All would
be scattered and fleeing for the mountains, and they
would remain scattered so long as the chase continued,
after which they would come together at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
some rendezvous perhaps twenty or fifty miles
away.</p>

<p>Far off to the southward a mountain range was
outlined against the sky. Looking keenly toward
the faint bluish line, the eyes that had the help of
field-glasses traced a thin, wavy column of smoke
ascending straight upward. About the same time
it was noticed that Geronimo and his hostiles had
headed in that direction.</p>

<p>“It is a signal and they are obeying it,” remarked
Lieutenant Decker, who was not the only member
of the party that was sorely disappointed.</p>

<p>Mendez checked his pony so that he fell back beside
the officer, who directed his attention to the
vapor, as he handed him his fieldglass. The
Apache held the instrument for several minutes to
his eye.</p>

<p>“That is made by a party of Apaches?” said the
lieutenant inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes—’Paches do dat for Geronimo.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“Dunno.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if it is a call for the old fellow to go
thither.”</p>

<p>“Yes—look like dat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see the need to signal him, for he’s his
own boss and knows what to do without directions
from any one else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he do,” assented Mendez, who seemed to
be suffering from a burst of talkativeness, altogether
unusual with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is there any use of our keeping up this chase,
Mendez?”</p>

<p>“No use, big fool to chase Geronimo.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll stop.”</p>

<p>And the troopers drew rein, talked a few minutes,
after which the lieutenant gave the orders to wheel
about and return to Camp Reno.</p>

<p>True the pursuit of Geronimo and his dreaded
warriors had ended in failure, and yet in the right
sense it was a brilliant success.</p>

<p>The Apaches had set out to raid a portion of
Sutra Valley, but were discovered in time and sent
skurrying back to their fastnesses, with the loss of
two of their number and without having been able
to set foot within the section which they had meant
to devastate. It was they who had met the most
egregious failure.</p>

<p>The chagrin of the troopers was that they were
unable to force the raiders to the wall and make them
fight. Could this have been done they might have
administered an effectual chastisement that would
have averted woful consequences. Geronimo and
these hostiles were off the reservation and were not
likely to return until after inflicting some of their
fearful blows. The revolt would spread and not
unlikely another miniature Indian war would follow,
which, if it roused little interest further east, would
have dreadful significance to those exposed to its
consequences.</p>

<p>These were the gloomy reflections that accompanied
the troopers on their return to Fort Reno,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and there is little doubt that their fears would have
become real, but for an unexpected series of events.</p>

<p>It so happened that at the very time Lieutenant
Decker was engaged on his scout, a party of about
the same strength was out from Fort McDowell, a
considerable distance to the south. Rumors of the
restlessness of the Apaches had reached them, and
they discovered that a band were heading for the
Sutra Valley. With no knowledge, however, that
the notorious Geronimo was their leader, the
cavalrymen made a determined and well-directed
effort to bring the raiders to book.</p>

<p>They were fortunate enough to discover the fleeing
hostiles when the latter were on the open plain,
and the troopers had the concealment of a wooded
and rocky range. Still better, the raiders headed
almost directly for the point where the scouts were
eagerly awaiting them.</p>

<p>The consequences were disastrous to the Apaches,
who did not learn of their danger until the bullets
of the troopers were doing their deadly work. The
terrified wretches fled to the nearest cover, losing
six of their number, while many others carried away
serious wounds.</p>

<p>Geronimo himself met with an exceedingly
narrow escape. He was slightly wounded by a rifle-ball
and was barely able to elude two troopers who
tried to run him down. Had either of them been
aware of his identity at the time, that famous
Apache would have scourged the border no more.</p>

<p>But, as will be seen, this was a severe blow to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
raiders, among whom were a number that were
much discouraged by the outcome. They had
counted confidently upon one of their most delightful
and soul-satisfying excursions, when not only
human lives but much plunder should be at their
disposal, but the survivors who rejoined their families
carried the gloomy news that more than one-third
of their number had been killed and there was
absolutely nothing to show for it.</p>

<p>One beneficent result, therefore, of the affair was
that a formidable insurrection was nipped in the
bud. Maroz and Ceballos were among those who
returned to the reservation, loud in their declarations
that it was useless to fight the white man
longer, and they had resolved to be good Indians
henceforth and forever.</p>

<p>When these two Apaches were questioned about
their presence with Geronimo, they replied just as
Lieutenant Decker said they would. They had entered
his camp, as ordered by the officer, their intention
being to help the white people, but Geronimo
compelled them to aid him. They had made
believe to do so, but were only awaiting a favorable
chance to desert to their real friends.</p>

<p>“I think,” said the lieutenant, “that we shall have
trouble with those two fellows again. What do you
say, Mendez?”</p>

<p>“Huh! leften’t right—dey bad ’Paches—soon
make trouble.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RANCHMAN’S HOME.</span></h2>

<p>The days became weeks, the weeks grew into
months and peace reigned in Southern Arizona, that
section which time and again was harried by the
fierce raids of the terrible Apaches, until many of
the ranchmen abandoned their homes and sought
safety at the posts and settlements.</p>

<p>The history of those outrages proves the fact
which has already been hinted: had the management
of the tribes been left to the army, the reign
of terror would have ended years before it became
necessary to run down Geronimo and the other disaffected
leaders and transport them to the east,
there to spend the remainder of their lives.</p>

<p>I have no intention of giving anything in the
nature of a history of the Indian troubles in the
Southwest, but a single episode will enforce what
has been said.</p>

<p>In April, 1873, Buckskin Hat, head chief of all
the Indians in the Tonto Basin, went to General
Crook and said he wished to surrender. Crook took
his hand and told him that if he and his people
would stop their outrages and become orderly citizens,
he would be the best friend they ever had. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
promised to teach them to work and agreed to find
a good market for everything they could produce.</p>

<p>Within a month General Crook had all the
Apaches in Arizona, excepting the Chiricahuas, who
were not within his jurisdiction, at work at Camp
Apache and Camp Verde, digging irrigating ditches,
planting vegetables, cutting hay and wood and with
everything on the highway to prosperity. Then a
gang of politicians and contractors, remembered as
the “Tucson Ring,” persuaded the authorities in
Washington to order the Apaches down to the
dismal sand waste of the San Carlos, where the
water is brackish, the soil worthless, and the flies
intolerable. Roused to fury by the injustice, the
Apaches took the warpath, and then followed those
terrible scenes which are matters of public record.</p>

<p>For a long time, Maurice Freeman was so doubtful
of the continuance of peace, that he was on the
point of removing from the territory. Indeed he
would have done so but for the persuasions of his
nearest neighbor and close friend, Captain Murray,
who insisted that no serious danger would come
again.</p>

<p>“You have established a pleasant home here,”
said the Union veteran; “the soil is fertile; the
country is rapidly settling; we shall soon have
schools, churches and all the advantages of civilization;
to abandon these now will be to throw away
that golden opportunity which does not come twice
to a man in this life. I intend to stick and you will
regret it if you do not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>And so Maurice Freeman allowed himself to be
persuaded and stayed.</p>

<p>By the time the frightfully hot summer was
drawing to close, Freeman was so convinced of the
wisdom of the advice given by his friend that he
thanked him for it.</p>

<p>“There hasn’t been a ripple since that flareup last
winter,” remarked Freeman, as he sat in a chair at
the front of his neighbor’s house and smoked a pipe
with him; “it looks as if Geronimo, Natchez and
the rest have made up their minds to do like their
race further east—accept the inevitable.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” replied Murray; “an Indian isn’t a
fool and when he sees it’s no use of fighting longer
he stops—that is, he generally does,” added the
speaker, conscious that his assertion needed a slight
qualification. “There will be occasional disturbances
now and then, but they will never amount to
anything.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we shall ever have a raid through
this section?”</p>

<p>“Never,” was the emphatic response; “it’s too
risky for those that attempt it; they haven’t the
chance of success that they had a year or even six
months ago. The soldiers at Camp Reno and the
other posts are on the alert and would detect anything
of the kind before it could come to a head.”</p>

<p>“I can’t feel quite so sure on that score as you,”
observed Freeman, with a vivid recollection of the
incidents of the previous winter; “it was only by
the merest accident that we learned of Geronimo’s
coming in time to head him off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must remember that that was more than
six months ago and great changes have taken place
since then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t question that fact, but the Apaches are
the worst desperadoes when roused that ever
cursed this continent.”</p>

<p>“By the way, captain, how was it you learned of
that intended raid? I was here at home and never
knew of it until you came back with the news.”</p>

<p>“I have never been able to find out the exact
means by which the news reached the ears of Lieutenant
Decker and his troopers. I was coming
from Fort Reno, when I met him and two of his
scouts, Mendez and Cemuri, who were hunting for
the hostiles. I presume that he got it from those
two White Mountain Apaches, who are the shrewdest
fellows at that business I ever knew. The lieutenant
virtually admitted as much to me, though he
never gave the particulars.”</p>

<p>“What has become of Mendez and Cemuri?”</p>

<p>“They have remained on the reservation, like the
loyal fellows they are, but they are so useful to the
colonel that he keeps them continually within call.
There are several peculiarities about those scouts.”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“Both are so addicted to that infernal tiswin,
that there’s no saying when they will not make
themselves helpless from drinking it, and the next is
that they seem to have become fond of Maroz and
Ceballos, two other Apaches.”</p>

<p>Captain Murray smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see nothing peculiar in an Apache Indian
being fond of tiswin; indeed he would be eccentric
if he was not, and what is remarkable in their
association with two others of their race?”</p>

<p>“During that flurry last winter, Maroz and
Ceballos were among the fiercest allies that Geronimo
had. Mendez overheard a conversation between the
two and Geronimo which proved their treachery.
At that time, Mendez would have shot both could he
have gained the chance. He and Cemuri know they
cannot be trusted and yet they seem to be bosom
friends.”</p>

<p>Captain Murray could not restrain the remark:</p>

<p>“You wore the gray and I the blue; it is not so
many years ago that we were striving to kill each
other; I don’t think there’s much of the desire left.
You must bear in mind that this is the era of good
feeling.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear fellow, your examples are not
parallel. You and I, like tens of thousands similarly
placed, will be the best of friends to the end, but an
Indian’s nature is different. He will nurse his
wrongs for ten or twenty years, to break out in a
fury when least expected. But,” added Freeman,
“you will begin to suspect from my words that I
am giving away to idle fears, which is not the case.
I believe with you that there’s not one chance in—say
a score—of this part of the country being raided
by hostile Indians.”</p>

<p>“Say not one chance in a thousand and you will
be in accord with my views.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can hardly put it as strong as that; but I’m
going to ride over to the fort to-morrow, and as the
day is sure to be like tophet, I will leave my Winchester
at home.”</p>

<p>“You would be foolish to do otherwise. I
haven’t carried mine for two months past. The
iron gets so hot that if you don’t look out it will
blister your hands, and the burden is an unnecessary
one.”</p>

<p>“Then,” added Freeman slyly, “if the Apaches
should happen to make one of their raids while I am
away, it will be a handy thing for Molly, for she
knows how to use it.”</p>

<p>“Have an end with such jests,” said his friend
impatiently, “or I will begin to suspect that you do
not believe what you have just been telling me.”</p>

<p>“Well, we will drop it,” said Freeman, shaking
out the ashes of his pipe and refilling it; “I can
only repeat my thanks for your arguments which
prevented me from pulling up stakes last spring and
leaving the country for good.”</p>

<p>“I may have been a trifle selfish about it, for I
didn’t wish to lose a good neighbor, with whom I
could sit down and fight over our old battles with
out either of us losing our temper. Since I admit
that all the bravery during the war was on your side
and you have graciously conceded that there wasn’t
a bit except on mine, why the dispute has never
become serious.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the visitor some time later,
“the night is wearing on and I will go home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Where is Fulton?” he asked, looking around as he
rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Your little boy ran off half an hour ago. My
youngster wanted him to stay all night, but Fulton
said it was Jack’s turn to stay with him and he
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you let Jack do so?”</p>

<p>“His mother thought he had better wait until to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Good-night,” called Freeman to his neighbor,
who responded, and remained at the front smoking
for an hour or more after his departure.</p>

<p>It was not a long walk to the home of Maurice
Freeman. When he reached there, he found it
later than he suspected, for his little boy and girl
had been put to bed and were asleep.</p>

<p>The husband announced that he expected to visit
the fort next day, and at his request his wife named
a few small articles for him to obtain for her.
The journey to Phœnix or Prescott was so much
longer, that neither Freeman nor Murray went
thither except when necessary. The ride to Fort
Reno, ten miles away, could be easily made within
the day and allow a good call at the post.</p>

<p>“I have been talking with Murray,” said the
husband, recalling their conversation; “he insists
that we shall never again be in danger from the
Apaches. I am inclined to agree with him, though
I can’t feel quite as positive as he. I told him,
however, that I intended to leave my Winchester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
at home, when I visit the camp to-morrow. What
do you think of it, Molly?”</p>

<p>Was it that wonderful intuition of her sex which
led the wife to reply without an instant’s hesitation,
“Leave the Winchester with me, Maurice?”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII-1">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SHADOW OF DANGER.</span></h2>

<p>Maurice Freeman was correct in his prophecy of
the weather for the following day. As had been
intimated, the temperature in some portions of the
Southwest, attains an intensity during the summer
and early autumn, which makes one wonder how animal
life withstands it. For weeks the thermometer
ranges far above a hundred, and there is a record
of it standing over a large area at one hundred and
ten at midnight, for a full week.</p>

<p>Life would be unbearable except for the dryness
of the climate, which renders a day more tolerable
than many in the east that are twenty degrees
lower, with a humidity which makes existence a
burden.</p>

<p>But Freeman was a native of the extreme South
and had lived in Arizona long enough to become
acclimated. He saw before the sun rose that
another “scorcher” was coming, but it did not deter
him from his intended twenty-mile ride to Fort
Reno and back. He partook of an early meal, kissed
his little boy and girl good-by and did the same
with his brave wife. Holding her for a moment
in his arms, he looked down in her brown eyes and
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so, Molly, you think it best that I should
leave the gun at home? Have you any special
reason for thinking so?”</p>

<p>“It will be a burden to you, during this hot day,”
was her evasive answer.</p>

<p>“But I have carried it many times and found it no
burden.”</p>

<p>“And of late you have left it behind because it
was an incumbrance; if you prefer to take it, do
so.”</p>

<p>“I prefer always to please my little wife,” he said,
kissing her once more, and finally: “I pray that
neither of us will ever need it again for the use to
which it has been put so many times.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was in the saddle and
headed for Fort Reno. He had abundance of time
at command and rode past the home of his friend,
Captain Murray.</p>

<p>“Is there anything I can do for you?” he called,
as the two greeted each other.</p>

<p>“Nothing for me, thanks, but something for yourself.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Keep cool; we are going to have another pull
at the furnace; I don’t envy you your ride.”</p>

<p>“I got used to all sorts of weather in the army;
so did you, but you are growing effeminate; luxury
and idleness are bad things, captain.”</p>

<p>“But none the less enjoyable for all that. How
is it you haven’t your Winchester with you?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you last night that I meant to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it with Molly, so that she shall be able to defend
herself, during my absence?”</p>

<p>“Defend herself against what?”</p>

<p>“Nothing; adios, my old friend.”</p>

<p>Freeman looked back as he made his military
salute, which was cordially answered by Murray.
That parting will be remembered by Freeman as
long as he lives.</p>

<p>“He is right,” reflected the ranchman, as he
struck the trail leading northward to the military
post which was his destination; “months have
passed since there has been a rumor of trouble with
the hostiles, and every week lessens the danger
which has hung over our homes like a pall of
death.”</p>

<p>In a comparative sense the early part of the day
was pleasant. The frightful heat would be felt in
all its intensity, as the sun climbed to meridian and
descended the western sky; and, since there was
abundant time in which to let his horse rest, Freeman
spurred him to an easy gallop, which was
continued without break for mile after mile.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the way was passed, when, in riding
up a slight elevation, the ranchman came face to
face with five Apaches, all of whom were well
mounted and armed. They were strangers, but the
white man knew they had been with the hostiles in
the recent troubles.</p>

<p>“It might be a handy thing if I had my rifle with
me just now,” he thought; “and yet this may be
one of the occasions when a man without weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
is safer than a walking arsenal, for he isn’t tempted
to do anything rash.”</p>

<p>A viciously inclined Indian is quick to seize his
opportunity. These five Apaches, if they chose,
could shoot the white man from his horse in a
twinkling, and the chances were that justice would
never overtake them, for no torture could force any
member of the party to betray the other.</p>

<p>The best course was to put a bold face on the
matter and Freeman did so. Instead of shying off
or making any move to avoid the Indians, he rode
directly toward them, so close indeed that there
was only room for them to meet and pass without
brushing knees. It need not be said, however, that
the white man kept his “weather eye” open.</p>

<p>As the parties came opposite, Freeman made a
salute, smiled and called out:</p>

<p>“Howdy?”</p>

<p>They responded in kind, one of them, who seemed
to be of mixed breed, grinning to the extent of
showing the two rows of his fine white teeth.
Their ponies were walking and Freeman’s heart
beat a little faster, when they seemed about to stop;
but he affected not to notice it and held the same
easy, swinging gallop.</p>

<p>The real trial was within the few minutes following
this meeting. Nothing was easier than for all
five to turn and fire a volley, and he half expected
they would do so. It was hard to restrain himself
from spurring his horse into a dead run and leaning
forward on his neck. This would have been his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
course had the Apaches made any demonstration,
but they did not, and he shrank from showing distrust,
much as prudence urged him to do so.</p>

<p>He had ridden less than a hundred yards when
he turned and looked behind him. All the Indians
were riding away at the same moderate pace and
not one displayed any interest in him.</p>

<p>The sight was an inspiriting one and did much to
remove the misgiving that had been with him to a
greater or less degree ever since he left home.</p>

<p>“That’s one of the most decisive tests of what
Captain Murray has been insisting upon for the past
week,” reflected Freeman, with a thrill of pleasure.
“It is not so many months since that a meeting
like this, where I am beyond any help, would
have been my death warrant, but now they do not
even turn to look at me.”</p>

<p>A half hour later he arrived at the fort, where
he was always welcome. He was acquainted with
all the officers, whose life at these remote inland
posts is sometimes intolerably monotonous. It is
the same routine, day after day, month after month,
from one year’s end to the other, with the eternal
brassy sky overhead, the dreary stretch of sandy
waste which grows more hateful to the eye, and
the vain sighing for an exchange with some of the
more favored posts, or a transfer to another branch
of the service.</p>

<p>To many of the ardent young officers who leave
West Point and assume the stirring duties of military
life, the news of trouble with the red men is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
most welcome. It not only serves to break the
monotony, but opens the prospect of the realization
of every soldier’s hope—promotion.</p>

<p>When making his call upon the colonel, Freeman
related the incident of his meeting with the Apaches,
commenting upon it as a pleasing omen. The
bronzed campaigner smiled and nodded his
head.</p>

<p>“Such is probably the fact; I know the bucks,
for they were here this morning; there is not a
worse set of scoundrels on the reservation. One of
them was the right hand of Cochise, before he
became a good Indian, another was with Natchez,
and the remaining three are murderers.”</p>

<p>“And yet they did not offer to molest me.”</p>

<p>The colonel shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“No, times have changed mightily within the
past year, and yet I cannot feel that this calm is
sure to last.”</p>

<p>“Why should it not continue forever?”</p>

<p>“Because human nature is as it is; if the politicians
would not interfere with our management of
the Apaches, there would be no trouble. Those
people, or rather the leaders, have had all the fighting
they want. They would settle down and give
no more trouble if treated right, but as long as
politics are what they are, so long will there be the
mischief to pay on the frontier.”</p>

<p>The officer had touched upon a phase of the
question to which Freeman had not lately given
much thought. The views of the colonel were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
those of an experienced and well-informed man and
they impressed his listener.</p>

<p>“You know, captain,” he continued, “that the
Indian doesn’t forget a wrong. He may seem to do
so, but none the less he broods over the injustice he
has suffered, and when he strikes the rule is that it
is the innocent and not the guilty who suffer.
When they have been plundered and robbed by the
‘ring,’ they turn upon and kill innocent men, women
and children. They simply regard themselves the
victims of the Caucasian and strike him wherever
and whenever the chance offers.”</p>

<p>“But this thing cannot go on forever. I have
been half inclined more than once to move out of
the Sutra Valley, but my old friend, Captain Murray,
my next door neighbor, dissuaded me. Do you
think I have acted wisely?”</p>

<p>The colonel pulled the ends of his mustache and
puffed thoughtfully at his cigar before answering:</p>

<p>“I hope so—yes, I think you have; the danger is
certainly less now than at any time in the past;
and, since you have gone through all that without
harm, the inference is fair that your chances are
better than ever.”</p>

<p>“Your views cause me some uneasiness,
colonel.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean that they should; I am neither
an optimist nor a pessimist, but try to look at things
as they are. Peace reigns now, but so long as we
have the Apaches with us, and so long as evil men
have the power to control Indian affairs, so long are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
we certain to have trouble. It may be that the
authorities will learn wisdom after awhile and show
common sense in treating with the ‘wards of the
nation,’ but I confess I have little hope of their
doing so for a long time to come.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII-1">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">A CRUEL BLOW.</span></h2>

<p>Freeman, having finished his call at the fort and
given his horse a good rest, remounted for his return
home. Despite the proofs received of the goodwill
of the Apaches on the reservation, he was disturbed
because of the opinion expressed by the colonel.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that startling news came
to the military post. Mendez, our old friend, the
White Mountain scout, dashed up, his horse covered
with foam, and his own appearance showing rough
treatment. It was not often that the stolid fellow
displayed agitation or excitement, but he was
greatly disturbed, as his story proved he had good
reason to be.</p>

<p>His statement was that Maroz and Ceballos had
thrown off the mask they had worn so long, had
left the reservation and were at that moment well
on their way to the Apache Mountains, to the south
of the Gila. Those fastnesses once reached, they
could defy the whole United States army to remove
them.</p>

<p>It was not the simple fact alone that these two
turbulent spirits had cast aside their disguise, but
they were sure to induce other disaffected ones to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
join them. Should they succeed in gathering a
dozen warriors or even less around them, another
costly Indian campaign was inevitable and a reign
of terror would follow in Southern Arizona.</p>

<p>Questioned regarding his old comrade Cemuri,
Mendez replied that he was dead, slain by Maroz in
the most treacherous manner conceivable. It was
evident that there had been a desperate fight, for
Mendez carried with him evidences of his own
savage treatment.</p>

<p>It was noted by some of those who listened to the
story, that Mendez was confused in a few of the
details. Those who knew him well saw evidence
that he had been indulging in the bane of his life,
“tiswin,” that curse of so many of his people, but
the exciting incident in which he had taken a prominent
part had sobered him and he was fully
himself.</p>

<p>Little time, however, was given to questioning the
scout. The alarming danger was manifest to all.
Serious work was at hand. Not an hour must be
lost in pursuing the hostiles, whose example was
likely to spread like a prairie fire. There was a
hasty call to saddle, and in less time than would be
deemed possible, several cavalrymen, all of whom
had seen similar service, were scurrying to the
southeast.</p>

<p>Naturally the first thought of Maurice Freeman,
when he learned what had occurred, was his own
family, ten miles away, with no suspicion of danger.
He pictured the little brother and sister at play outdoors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and the mother singing about her household
duties, while the fearful shadow stole down upon
them, as the deadly serpent winds its way through
the tall grass and strikes its blow before its presence
is suspected.</p>

<p>He thought, too, of Captain Murray, whose confidence
in the continuance of peace was not to be
shaken by argument or persuasion. He had ridiculed
the fears of Freeman, but what would he say
now when the news reached him?</p>

<p>Freeman had never taken pains to conceal his
distrust of Maroz and Ceballos, after learning of
their treachery the previous winter when Geronimo
was turned back from his contemplated raid into
the Sutra Valley. In fact, the ranchman had told
Maroz to his face that he deserved shooting for his
double dealing, and if he could have his way he
would see that such punishment was inflicted.
There could be no doubt, therefore, that the two
renegades remembered the bitter words and would
be eager to wreak revenge upon him who uttered
them.</p>

<p>And yet there was one feature of the situation
which brought the ranchman unspeakable relief.
Mendez had said that when the hostiles leaped upon
their ponies they headed for the Apache Mountains,
which, it will be borne in mind, are on the southern
side of the Salt River, while the Sutra Valley, in
which he and a few of his friends had their homes,
lies to the north. That broad, winding stream
flows between, besides which an additional number
of miles separate the two sections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>This knowledge I repeat was a great relief to the
ranchman, as he turned the head of his horse homeward.
So long as the hostiles pushed southward,
so long was the safety of his family assured. There
was no call to press his pony, especially as the heat
was increasing and the animal was likely to suffer
more than his rider.</p>

<p>“It’s a curious coincidence,” he reflected, “that
it is two years this very day since we moved into
the Territory. Molly and I have had hard work,”
he added, as he drew a match along his thigh and
lighted his pipe without checking his steed, “and
she has been a true helpmate to me. We have a
comfortable home and no sickness has visited us.
Settlers are coming into the valley and before long
we shall be a town the rival of Tucson, Prescott,
Phœnix, Benson and the rest of them. Then will
come the churches and schools that Captain Murray
is looking for, and we shall be able to educate our
children properly; but permanent peace must first
be established.”</p>

<p>The course of the trail was almost parallel with
the river, but some distance from it crossing several
small streams, most of which were fringed with
stunted trees, where a grateful shade could be
secured. He humored his faithful animal so far as
he could, without allowing him to halt, until two-thirds
of the distance was passed.</p>

<p>One fact curiously disturbed Freeman, despite
the assurance received from Mendez: it was that
he had left his Winchester at home by the direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
request of his wife. He recalled that more than
once in their lives her intuition, or whatever it may
be termed, had revealed to her the shadow of coming
events, when he saw nothing of them. Could it be
so in the present instance?</p>

<p>The strange misgiving grew upon him as he
advanced, until finally he touched spur to his horse,
and despite the extreme heat, struck him into a
gallop.</p>

<p>“There can’t be any doubt of Mendez,” he concluded;
“and when he said the two headed southward
for the mountains, on the other side of the
river, he spoke the truth, but Maroz and Ceballos
may have changed their minds, without his knowledge,
or possibly the action of the hostiles was intended
to mislead him. Laying their plans to
draw the soldiers into the Apache Mountains, they
could have recrossed the stream, dashed the few
remaining miles, and swept through the valley like
a whirlwind.”</p>

<p>Lest it may seem that the fear of Freeman was
groundless, it should be remembered that there were
no ranches or settlements on the southern side of
the river in that vicinity. They were to the east
and west, but so far removed as to be in little
danger from this particular band of hostiles.</p>

<p>The innate viciousness of the Apache nature
would not allow them simply to take to the mountains,
and there defy the United States Government
to bring them back: that would be altogether
too tame. They must strike one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
blows, even though they knew the great personal
risk involved.</p>

<p>Those blows, as a matter of course, would be delivered
where the best opportunity offered. The
nearest white people would receive them, and the
ones thus exposed were the several families along
the Sutra Valley, of which his own was one.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that Maurice Freeman
was in anything but a restful frame of mind as his
mustang cantered along the trail leading from Fort
Reno, up the Sutra Valley, to the several homes
scattered throughout that section.</p>

<p>“I hope I am mistaken,” he said, “but I can only
wait and see.”</p>

<p>He strained his eyes toward the point where he
knew his cabin stood, and which must rise to view
before going a half mile further. If the Apaches
were there, the first sign to catch his eye would be
the smoke from his burning home; the next the
lifeless bodies of his wife and children, and no man
ever prayed more fervently than he that the sight
might be spared to him.</p>

<p>But if the hostiles were in the neighborhood, he
did not forget that he himself was riding into imminent
and increasing peril. Those Apaches have
more than once ambushed a wagon train, in the
middle of a sandy plain, devoid of every tree, rock
and blade of grass. The searching glances which
he cast to the right and left, as he sped along, might
flit over the very spot where the warriors were
crouching and waiting for him to come a little
nearer before opening their deadly fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>But he could not afford to wait or follow a more
circuitous course: his anxiety was to reach his
family with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>A little further, and his eager eyes would catch
sight of that humble home, where all that was
dear in this world was gathered. He had but to
gallop down that little slope just ahead, across the
tiny stream winding below, then up the higher slope
beyond, when the valley would open out before him
for miles.</p>

<p>The pony seemed to catch the excitement, and,
without waiting for the touch of the spur, he
increased his pace, even though the pitiless rays of
the sun scorched his haunches and flanks until the
steamy perspiration dried up and vanished. The
sky above the site of his home remained of crystalline
clearness and the pulsating atmosphere was
unstained by any vapor.</p>

<p>Splash, splash, dashed the mustang through the
shallow water without pausing to moisten his parching
throat—then up the brief incline at the same
headlong speed, and the next moment the rider
uttered a groan and his heart seemed to cease beating;
for, directly ahead, he saw the ascending
smoke of a burning building.</p>

<p>“The Apaches are there!” he exclaimed, and he
was right.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII-2">CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">“NOW FOR IT.”</span></h2>

<p>It was at the moment Maurice Freeman’s mustang
struck the crest of the slight elevation, beyond
the small brook, that he descried the ominous vapor
rising in the direction of his own home.</p>

<p>There could be but one cause for the smoke that
was growing denser every minute; it was from a
burning building that had been fired by the renegade
Apaches, Maroz and Ceballos, with perhaps
several others they had gathered in their flight
from the reservation; but the parent’s anguish was
quickly relieved by the discovery that, instead of
rising from the ruins of his own home, it ascended
from the dwelling of Captain Murray, further up
the valley. The two houses being in a line, it was
natural that Freeman in his alarm should make the
mistake, which he saw almost instantly.</p>

<p>But the relief was only momentary. The renegades
were at hand, and had probably visited the
nearest cabin before laying the other in flames. As
the settler spurred his pony into a dead run, and
without any thought of the consequences to himself,
he was terrified by the tomblike stillness and
the absence of all signs of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“They have done their work there and hurried
on to the captain’s,” was his thought.</p>

<p>But never did the brave Molly look so sweet and
beautiful, even in the delightful long ago, as when
she stepped from the front door of the home with
the Winchester in one hand, while she waved the
other in salutation to her husband. The happy man
snatched off his slouch hat, swung it aloft, and
emitted a shout of joy such as he and his brothers
sent forth when making the desperate charge in the
heat of battle that led to victory.</p>

<p>“It looks as if it wasn’t a mistake after all,” he
concluded, “to leave my gun behind me.”</p>

<p>He was out of the saddle before the panting pony
could halt, and caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>“Thank God, Molly!” he exclaimed, “but what
does this mean?” he asked, observing her white face
and trembling form. “Has anything happened to
the children? Where are they? Ah, Fannie?”</p>

<p>And catching the tiny girl in his arms, he flung
her aloft and caught her as she came down, fairly
smothering her with kisses, while his own eyes grew
dim with tears.</p>

<p>“Now, Fulton, my little man, it is <em>your</em> turn!”</p>

<p>But the longing gaze showed no sign of the little
fellow through the open door, and he turned
affrightedly to the wife who had sunk upon the
bench just outside, and was on the verge of swooning.</p>

<p>“Molly!” he said, releasing Fannie, and tenderly
placing his hand upon his wife’s shoulder; “what
is the trouble? Where is Fulton?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—don’t—know!” was the faint response.</p>

<p>“Why, mamma let him go to Mr. Murray’s,” said
the sister in her artless manner, “and he hasn’t
come back yet.”</p>

<p>It was the father now who was in danger of giving
way. The loved forms, the house and all objects
in his field of vision began flickering in an odd
fashion before his eyes—darkness hovered in the air,
and he stepped weakly to the bench, beside his wife,
without uttering a word.</p>

<p>But he was a strong man, and speedily gained the
mastery of himself. Molly had done the same, and
with the eager eyes of her husband fixed upon her
white face, she told her story.</p>

<p>Their little boy had gone to the home of Captain
Murray, as Fannie said, to spend the day with the
captain’s children. He went early in the morning,
and she had no expectation of seeing him again until
late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>It was perhaps two hours later when Fannie, who
was playing outside, hurried within, saying some Indians
were coming over the ridge on horseback, and
they were riding fast toward the house. Mrs. Freeman
was too quick-witted to hesitate a moment. The
approaching red men might be friendly or they
might be enemies. The fact of their speeding so
hard in the direction of the house was startling,
and, without waiting to decide the question, she
took the wise course of acting on the theory that
they were enemies.</p>

<p>The door was hastily barred; Fannie was placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in a corner where no stray shots could reach her,
and taking down the Winchester the mother peered
cautiously out of one of the windows. She saw
four repellent Apaches reining up their ponies, less
than a hundred yards away; she saw them, too,
bring their guns to their shoulders, and the next
instant the room was filled with fragments of window
panes, shattered by their bullets.</p>

<p>The woman wanted no other proof than this of
the designs of her assailants. Kneeling on the
floor, she rested the barrel of the Winchester on the
window sill, and keeping so far back that she was
not seen, took deliberate aim and pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>The shot hit the bull’s-eye. She had handled the
weapon many a time before, and she was as cool as
a veteran when she tumbled the Apache to the
earth. He had time to utter only a single screech
when he stretched out motionless on the ground,
with his mustang circling beyond in frightened bewilderment.</p>

<p>Without shifting her position, Mrs. Freeman fired
again. She did damage, though to a less extent
than before. Her bullet bored its way through the
pony of a second warrior, and he stumbled to the
ground so suddenly that his rider was obliged to
move nimbly to avoid being caught beneath.</p>

<p>The Apaches had not counted upon this reception,
and the survivors lost no time in placing themselves
further from the rifle that was speaking so
effectively. The single defender kept close watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
upon them, but it will be seen, that despite the brilliant
manner in which she had acquitted herself,
she was still in great peril. There was only one
condition that could save her.</p>

<p>Maroz, Ceballos and their surviving ally did not
dare to wait long enough to push the fight. They
were aware that their flight from the reservation
had become known, and more than likely a squad
of cavalry was already thundering on their trail.
There was no hope in lingering in the Sutra Valley,
nor indeed anywhere north of the river. Their
destination was the Apache Mountains to the south,
and they had but to delay their flight only a brief
while to find it cut off altogether.</p>

<p>But for this, they would have pressed the attack,
burned the house, despite all the brave woman could
do, and wreaked revenge on her and her child; but
an Apache is too cunning to run unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>During the five or ten minutes following the fall
of the hostile, one of the survivors gave an exhibition
of the astonishing activity and power of his
people. He made a dash across the open plain, and,
though the riderless pony was going at high speed,
he overhauled him in a twinkling, leaped deftly
upon his bare back, wheeled him short round, and
plunged toward the cabin, as if making a direct
charge upon it.</p>

<p>While the amazed wife was holding her rifle in
position, and wondering what all this could mean,
the steed described a graceful circle and his rider
became invisible for a few seconds. He had thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
himself over the animal’s side, and, holding himself
in position by one foot curved over the pony’s neck
and the left hand knotted in his mane, he reached
down with the other arm, and, hardly abating the
pace of his horse, slid it under the body of his lifeless
comrade, and swung back to an upright position,
with the limp form held securely in front.</p>

<p>The better to execute this feat, he had cast his
rifle to the earth, so as to allow the unrestrained
use of his hands. He now guided the mustang to
the spot where the weapon lay on the parched
grass, and, still riding fast, and with one arm fully
engaged in sustaining the body in position, he leaned
over again, snatched up his Winchester as if it were
a handkerchief, inclined himself forward to escape
the expected shot, and with the same speed as at
first, joined his companions, who were calmly awaiting
him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Freeman might have brought down the
miscreant while he was engaged in this daring feat,
but she was mystified until the most striking part
was over, and then, womanlike, a feeling of sympathy
restrained the shot, which she regretted very
soon had not been fired.</p>

<p>From a distance, too great to render them effective,
the Apaches discharged several parting shots,
and dashed up the valley in the direction of Captain
Murray’s home. The danger, so far as Mrs.
Freeman and Fannie were concerned, was over, for,
as has been shown, the Apaches did not dare wait
nor return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>But when she observed the ponies with their
fierce riders speeding up the valley like a whirlwind,
she recalled that her only son, little Fulton,
was at the nearest dwelling, and that he, like the
family, was in a peril whose imminence could not
be exaggerated.</p>

<p>The mother was in a sad state of bewilderment.
But for the young daughter, she would have set
out on foot, or mounted the remaining pony, grazing
some distance away, where it had escaped the
raiders, and hurried to the help of the imperiled
ones. Who shall understand her agony when,
shortly after, she heard the rifle-shots and soon discerned
the dark smoke which told that the Apaches
had met with far more success in their second than
in their first attempt?</p>

<p>It was at this trying moment that she opened the
door and peered to the westward, in the hope of
seeing her husband returning from Fort Reno.
The wish was granted, and, hurrying forward, it
required only a few minutes for him to learn all
that had taken place.</p>

<p>If the wife could not hasten to the help of her
child, the husband was granted that privilege.</p>

<p>“You are safe here, Molly,” said he, springing to
his feet, “even though I must leave you without any
weapons; the Apaches are making for the mountains,
and the soldiers are after them. I will hurry
up the valley to the captain’s, and possibly may be
able to do something, though there is little hope.”</p>

<p>The second pony was not in sight, and he feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
it had been stolen by the marauders, but the grass
was much better on the other side of the ridge, in
the direction of the river, and the mustangs generally
wandered to that neighborhood when left to
themselves. The signals of the owner were quickly
answered by the animal, which came trotting over
the elevation, with a whinny, as if of inquiry, and
stood quiet while the saddle, bridle and accouterments
were transferred from the other animal to
him.</p>

<p>An affectionate embrace and kiss were given to
the wife and little one, and then, swinging himself
into the saddle, Maurice Freeman pointed the nose
of his mustang up the valley, and spurred him to a
dead run, with outstretched neck, flying mane and
tail and snorting nostrils. As if he understood that
he had set out to save human life, he paid no more
heed to the blistering heat than did his rider, who
closed his mouth hard, as he refilled the empty
chambers of his Winchester without drawing rein.</p>

<p>The wooden structure, which was Captain Murray’s
home, had been seasoned by the flaming sun
for weeks and months, so that when the torch was
applied it burned like tinder. Before half the distance
was passed by the furious rider, it was a
mass of smouldering ruins, from which the smoke
still ascended and stained the clear air above.</p>

<p>Freeman now drew rein, for it would have been
folly to continue his headlong flight without learning
what was in front. He saw nothing of white
men or Indians, as he drew still nearer, and rightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
suspected that the hostiles, having delivered their
blow, were now making for the mountains with all
speed.</p>

<p>“And where is the captain?—where is his wife?—where
are his children?—and where, heaven tell
me! is my own boy?”</p>

<p>It was the last query that wrung his heart with
an anguish, such as only a parent can feel, when he
believes that a loved child is irrecoverably lost.</p>

<p>“They have gone,” he added, as he made a
cautious circle of the smoking ruins, “they have
done their work well——”</p>

<p>The most torturing trial of his life was now upon
him. When he muttered to himself that the Apaches
had done their work well, he meant far more
than the burning of the home. That was a trifle
compared with the other sight which greeted him
while making his awed circuit of the ruins.</p>

<p>He saw the forms stretched on the ground, with
their white faces turned toward the brassy sky, and
he needed no one to tell him what it meant. There
was the father, lying within a dozen steps of the
wife, whom he had defended with his last breath,
and just beyond, and nearer the doorstep, a little
girl lay with one dimpled arm doubled under her
cheek, as if she were sleeping. And so she was,
but it was the long dreamless slumber which knows
no waking in this world.</p>

<p>The sight which caused the heart of the father
to stand still was that of the figure of a little boy,
still nearer and indeed on the very threshold. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
face was turned away, so that he could not see the
features, and the clothing was so disarranged that
he could not identify it.</p>

<p>At such times suspense is unbearable. Without
dismounting he forced his reluctant pony so close
to the burning wood that the additional heat
checked him. Then he leaned over his saddle,
and peered down into the face of the boy, now in
plain view.</p>

<p>It was Jack, the son of his old friend, or rather
what was left of the lad.</p>

<p>Then, with the same hard expression on his countenance,
the father straightened up in his saddle,
and allowed his gaze to roam over the burning
sticks, beams and timbers, the most of which was
already ashes. He did not spare himself, and, when
the survey was completed, he knew that which he
dreaded to see with an unspeakable dread was not
there, nor anywhere near.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he repeated, casting his eyes around the
immediate field of vision, “they have done their
work well. The captain, his wife, his little child,
and boy are all gone—perished within a few
minutes of each other. Why my child is not among
them I do not understand. For some cause they
have spared him yet awhile, but what hope is there
of his mother or me ever seeing him alive again?”</p>

<p>A shout caused him to turn his head quickly, and
look to the southward. There they were: five
horsemen coming down upon him like mad. At their
head, was handsome James Decker, the young lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
from West Point, who was getting a further
taste of soldiering in dead earnest.</p>

<p>The lieutenant’s companions were veterans, and
all had been in the service before he was born.
Our old friends Armon Peyser, Budge Colgate and
Jack Redfield served creditably during the Civil
War, and the leader had already learned something
of Mendez, the White Mountain Apache, who was
the guide to the party. As for that, both Colgate
and Redfield were almost, if not quite, as familiar
with the fastnesses of the Apache Mountains as
Mendez, for they had been in more than one
campaign that led them thither.</p>

<p>It was the lieutenant who uttered the shout that
turned the gaze of Freeman to the ridge, on the
crest of which they had just appeared. He had
recognized the man, and the latter knew him the
moment he looked up.</p>

<p>Instead of continuing down the slope to the site of
the burned building, the young officer called:</p>

<p>“If you want to join us, hurry up!”</p>

<p>Freeman answered by sending his pony off at a
rate which quickly placed him among the eager
group.</p>

<p>“I see they’ve been there,” remarked Decker,
with a nod toward the smoking ruins.</p>

<p>“I should say they had,” was the bitter response.</p>

<p>“Did they wipe them all out?”</p>

<p>“They did not spare one.”</p>

<p>“Your family was fortunate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they have carried off my little boy,”
replied the father in a broken voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is it possible?” was the sympathetic response;
“there may be a chance of recovering him. Those
fellows played us a sharp trick. They left a plain
trail, straight to the river, and without sticking to
it, we made for another and better crossing, only to
learn, after reaching the other side, that they had
entered the river, waded up stream a little way, and
then turned back again. Their natural viciousness
would not allow them to leave without striking this
blow, even though it was so dangerous to themselves.
They have picked up two allies.”</p>

<p>“But have only one left; the other was a victim
to my Winchester, fired by my wife.”</p>

<p>“Good! that’s business; but here’s the trail leading
directly toward the river, and they can’t be far
ahead. Do you want to go with us?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t turn back for the world, till I learn
what has become of my boy.”</p>

<p>“It’s only two miles to the river, and we may overtake
them before they cross. We are well mounted
and here we go!”</p>

<p>And the dashing officer thundered away on a
dead run, with the rest bunched closely on the
flanks of his mustang. The ground was gently
undulating, and they skimmed over it with arrowy
swiftness until the lieutenant, who maintained his
position slightly in advance, rose in his stirrups, and,
peering ahead, shouted:</p>

<p>“Yonder they are, boys! There’s a fight ahead!
Now for them!”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII-2">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">“SEE DERE!”</span></h2>

<p>Lieutenant James Decker had been warned more
than once by the older and more experienced
officers of his regiment that, sooner or later, his
ardor would bring him to grief. He was so eager for
a brush with the Apaches, that he charged headlong
into the affray, forgetful that the foe was the most
cunning, brave and skillful of any tribe on the
American continent.</p>

<p>It was Decker who, on his first campaign against
Geronimo, brought a sharp reprimand upon himself
from the captain, for his recklessness in front of a
rocky edge, at a time when it was known the wily
chieftain and his band had been brought to bay.
The command had dismounted, and were lying on
the ground, behind their prostrate steeds, or whatever
protection they could secure, waiting for a
chance at the miscreants, among the rocks, but a
short distance away. And while they were lying
thus, what did the lieutenant do but spur his pony
forward, and deliberately gallop back and forth,
between the two lines, where it would seem it was
the easiest thing in the world for Geronimo or one
of his men to tumble him from the saddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>At first Captain Grindle could hardly believe his
eyes; then he thought the young officer was
“rattled” to that extent that he was unaware of
what he was doing; but he quickly saw the true
state of affairs, and Decker was ordered instantly
to fall back. As he turned to obey the peremptory
command, several shots were fired from the rocks
behind him, but, scorning to throw himself forward
on the neck of his animal, he rode slowly back,
freely expressing his opinion of the timidity of the
other officers and men.</p>

<p>It was Decker, too, who, on another occasion of
still greater peril, pretended he did not hear the
order of his superior officer to withdraw, and
spurred his horse straight at a group of red men,
using his revolver and sword with a vigor and effect
that thrilled the veteran campaigners who witnessed
the scene. It took a charge of a dozen cavalrymen
to extricate the fellow, but he came back without a
scratch. He did good service, too, as has been told,
in checking the raid of Geronimo the previous
winter.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, the best of fortune had attended
Lieutenant Decker thus far. He had played
the part of target for Apache rifles more times than
he could count, but the astonishing fact remained
that not a hair of his head had as yet been harmed.</p>

<p>But this could not last, however. Unless he
mended his ways and showed more discretion, he
must go down as many a brave man had gone before
him. But, as I have said, he was liked by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
command and associates; for, aside from his fine
personal qualities, he was a leader, instead of a
follower, in all emergencies where dashing heroism
was required.</p>

<p>Every one of the six men who gave their steeds
rein and charged southward toward the Gila in
pursuit of the fleeing Apaches was splendidly
mounted. It would have been folly to take up the
pursuit under any other conditions. The time was
likely to come when their animals could not serve
them, and they would have to dismount and push
on afoot, but until then they must ride hard and
unceasingly.</p>

<p>The well-known qualities of the leader of the
little company caused Maurice Freeman keen misgiving.
He knew that if ever the moment should
arrive when Maroz and Ceballos saw they could not
hold their little prisoner, they would put him to
death with no more compunction than they would
crush the rattlesnake in their path. In an enterprise
of this kind there was urgent call for subtlety
of the highest order. The father was so impressed
with the fact that he reminded the lieutenant of it
while they were riding side by side. Decker nodded
his head, and said:</p>

<p>“I won’t forget it; I wish the boy was somewhere
else, not only for his own sake, but that his
presence among the Apaches might not handicap
us. I would like to drive those fellows into a
corner before they could cross, and then sail into
them! There would be three less Apaches to raise
the mischief than now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what do you intend to do?” asked the
parent, unable to understand his plans without more
enlightenment.</p>

<p>The lieutenant turned his frank face toward the
anxious one on his left, and replied:</p>

<p>“The prime object of this business is to save your
boy; I know how you feel, and I feel for you; the
colonel and the rest condemn me for being reckless,
but that is only where <em>men</em> are involved; I’ll
show that I can be as cautious and as patient as
any of them, when there is need of being so.”</p>

<p>“But—lieutenant——”</p>

<p>“I know what you are going to say; my actions
just now don’t indicate that, for they mean a
fight. Nevertheless, I’ll prove my earnestness if I
have the chance. My plan is to bring them to bay
this side of the river. Then, before we fire a shot,
I’ll let them know that, if they surrender and give
up the boy, they won’t be punished.”</p>

<p>“But how can you do <em>that</em>?” was the astonished
inquiry of Freeman.</p>

<p>“Easily; I’ve been in the country long enough
to pick up a fair knowledge of their lingo, and
you’ll admit that I am the proprietor of a pretty
good voice.”</p>

<p>“But will the murder of Captain Murray and his
family be allowed to go unpunished?”</p>

<p>“It ought not to, but that will have to be a condition.
The colonel told me when I left the fort
to get word to Maroz and Ceballos that they would
be treated leniently if they stopped at once and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
returned to the reservation. We knew they had
slain Cemuri, but that would be overlooked.”</p>

<p>“Think of Captain Murray and his family!”</p>

<p>“I have done so; the colonel, if he knew that,
would not permit the offer on my part, but I have
his warrant for giving the pledge, and I’ll do it for
the sake of your child, if the chance is given.
There is dishonesty among the traders and some of
the settlers, but the renegades know as well as you
that when the army makes a pledge it will be kept,
no matter at what cost.”</p>

<p>Maurice Freeman always admired the dashing
lieutenant, but he never appeared so handsome to
him as when, with a glowing face, he uttered these
words. The heart of the brave fellow was as
tender as a woman’s and the prime purpose of the
dangerous business on which he had entered was to
save the innocent child from the fate that impended
over it.</p>

<p>Meantime the chase was pushed with all possible
vigor. Every pony was doing his level best, and
neither he nor his rider cared for the pitiless rays
that darted down upon their heads like spears of
fire. There was scarcely a tree between them and
the river flowing across their course. A couple of
brooks were passed, but the major portion of the
route was an undulating plain, sandy in most places,
but rich and fertile in others, with a surprising
luxuriance of grass, which rendered it a favorite
grazing resort for animals.</p>

<p>Further to the west and north, where many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
extensive ranches were to be found, the grazing was
no better, and often not so good. Miles to the
southward, beyond the calmly flowing river, the
ragged Apache range lifted its crest against the sky,
stretching east and west, further than the eye could
reach, and forming one of the wildest spurs of the
Rocky Mountain system.</p>

<p>It was toward the fastnesses of this range that the
hostiles were making with the desperate energy of
men who knew that success meant life and failure the
opposite. If they could place the river between
them and their pursuers, they would be safe: could
they do it?</p>

<p>The dusky horsemen were about a mile from the
river when the first sight of them was obtained.
Lieutenant Decker, who had forged slightly ahead
of the rest, thundered up one of the numerous
slopes, only a few feet in height, at the moment
that the fugitives shot over the crest of a similar
one. They were seen distinctly riding close together,
and with their ponies at the highest speed.</p>

<p>“We are gaining!” shouted the lieutenant;
“don’t spare your horses! we shall catch them!”</p>

<p>In truth the animals had not been spared from
the first. It was cruel to push them thus, but the
stakes warranted it. That little life was worth
more than the lives of any multitude of mustangs.</p>

<p>The fact that the whites had gained up to this
time was ground for belief they would continue to
do so, and much ought to be done before the stream
was reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly a word was exchanged, except now and
then, between the lieutenant and Mr. Freeman.
Peyser, Colgate and Redfield kept their ponies at
the high pace, while they sat grimly in their saddles
leaning forward to catch the earliest sight possible
of the fugitives. Mendez rode his own mustang,
a wiry little mare of coal black color, that was one
of the hardiest and fleetest of her kind.</p>

<p>The White Mountain Apache kept a little to the
left of the rest, as if he preferred the companionship
of his thoughts to that of men. The speed of his
animal lifted the coarse black hair, that generally
dangled about his shoulders, and caused it to flutter
in a gale, like the mane and tail of his steed. His
stolid face was without pain, and it must be confessed
that it was not pleasant to look upon. It
was broad, with protruding cheek bones, the mouth
was wide, and the nose was scarred and broken
years before in some ugly affray of which he never
spoke.</p>

<p>The American Indian always shows little muscular
development, but those half-bare arms and legs
were like tempered steel. Mendez, more than once,
had trotted up the side of a mountain, for a quarter
of a mile, and, when he stopped, his respiration was
no faster than at starting. Many others of his
people have done the same thing and can do it to-day.</p>

<p>He had ridden his mustang into the mountains as
far as he could go, and when three days passed,
with not a mouthful of food, he slew his pony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
devoured what he wanted, and then pushed on for
three days more, without eating, during two of
which he did not taste a drop of water.</p>

<p>And through all that period, the temperature
during the day never sank below a hundred degrees.
The swarthy foe whose trail he was following (and
whom he ultimately bagged) did almost precisely
the same thing, and the endurance of neither was
greater than that of the majority of their people at
this very hour.</p>

<p>Mendez rode without saddle, and his only bridle
was a piece of lariat loosely looped about the neck
of his mustang, just back of the head. There was
little need of that, for he readily guided the movements
of the animal by the touch of the hand or
heel or his voice.</p>

<p>Whether the renegades to the southward had
seen their pursuers before the latter caught sight of
them cannot be known, but within the succeeding
five minutes a most unpleasant truth became
manifest: they were fully as well mounted as the
whites. Lieutenant Decker muttered impatiently
when the fact could no longer be ignored:</p>

<p>“Their outbreak and flight were no sudden impulse,”
he concluded, “for had it been they could
not have made such complete preparations. There
are no better ponies in the country than those they
are riding.”</p>

<p>Shortly after this decision was reached another
unpleasant discovery broke upon the whites, or
rather upon Mendez, for he was the first to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
it, and told the rest in a few words of his broken
English.</p>

<p>When first seen there were three of the flying
Apaches, corresponding with the number that had
fired the home and destroyed the family of Captain
Murray. The second scrutiny of the band revealed
the astonishing fact that there were now four, who
were pushing desperately for the river.</p>

<p>Where in the name of all that was wonderful the
fourth horseman had come from was beyond the
understanding of the pursuers, unless a glimmer of
the truth stole through the brain of Mendez. If so,
he kept it to himself.</p>

<p>The first thought of the lieutenant and Freeman
was that the lifeless warrior, which the Apaches
were bearing away, had been set upon a pony, and
so fixed that he could keep upright during the
flight; but to do that an additional animal was necessary,
and his sudden appearance was as amazing
as that of his rider.</p>

<p>The most probable theory was that the new reinforcement
had been waiting somewhere along the
line of flight, and fell into line when the proper
time arrived; but the disquieting conviction could
not be avoided that Maroz and Ceballos had not
only made deliberate preparations for their crimes,
but had more allies than at first was suspected.</p>

<p>All this was bad enough, but still worse was to
come.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker shook his head:</p>

<p>“There’s no stopping them; they’ll cross the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
in the face of all we can do; they must be followed
into the mountains, and by that time there is likely
to be a dozen of them together.”</p>

<p>Freeman made no answer, for he had none to
make, but he observed that the officer now abated
the killing pace of his horse. Since it was impossible
to overtake the Apaches in a fair pursuit, and
there was no possible way of preventing them from
crossing the river, it was cruel to hold the animals
at such exhausting speed.</p>

<p>Sure enough, when the horsemen struck the northern
bank of the stream, the others were emerging
on the southern shore. Their animals had swam
most of the way, for the river was deep. The enemies
were now in plainer sight of each other than
ever.</p>

<p>Reining up his horse, Lieutenant Decker leveled
his glass and studied the Apaches with the utmost
care during the few minutes the opportunity presented.
He had no difficulty in identifying Maroz
and Ceballos, who, halting their ponies in plain
sight, made tantalizing gestures and uttered defiant
shouts in a mixture of Apache and English.</p>

<p>The other bucks were strangers to the officer,
though he was quite sure he had seen one of them
at the fort. It was the latter who still supported
the body of his fallen friend on his horse, as if
resolved that it should not fall into the hands of
their pursuers.</p>

<p>Maroz held young Fulton Freeman on the mustang
in front of him. Not only that, but he raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the lad, and steadied him on his feet, so as so make
sure his friends saw him. The boy stared wonderingly
across the river, as if searching for some one
whom he knew. He would have recognized his
father had not the latter shrank behind the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Don’t move,” he said to the officer in a husky
voice; “I can’t stand it if he sees and calls to me.
Tell me when he is gone!”</p>

<p>The strong man bowed his head, while the others
silently watched the scene on the other shore.</p>

<p>In reply to the taunts of Maroz and his companions,
the lieutenant now called back, that if they
would return to the reservation, restoring their
prisoner unharmed to his friends, and would promise
henceforth to be good Indians, they should not
suffer for what they had already done.</p>

<p>The answer to this offer was so insulting that the
officer ground his teeth, and prayed that he might
once get within arm’s reach of the miscreant before
the business ended. Possibly, had the Apaches
been checked in their flight before reaching the
river, they might have accepted the offer; but then,
had such good fortune befallen the pursuers, it is
unlikely the offer would have been made, unless
necessary to save the life of the young prisoner.</p>

<p>Having scorned the olive branch, Maroz and
Ceballos emphasized the refusal by deliberately firing
a couple of shots at their pursuers, the bullets
whistling uncomfortably near their ears. Then, to
show how much they despised the soldiers, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
rode away at a walk, instead of dashing off at full
speed.</p>

<p>The strongest proof that Lieutenant Decker could
give to Maurice Freeman of his self-restraint was
when he forbade any of his men to return the fire.
The conclusion was fair that one or more of the hostiles
could be hit, for there was not a poor marksman
in the party; but little Fulton Freeman was as likely
to be struck as they, and, if not, his captors would
show their characteristic enmity against him.</p>

<p>“You can look up now, Freeman!” said Decker
to the parent, sitting motionless and with bowed
head behind him.</p>

<p>The father did so, without a word, and observed
the Apaches riding off, Maroz and Ceballos bearing
to the left, while the other two, with their inanimate
burden, trended to the right. The fugitives
had split into two equal divisions, which, if they
continued to diverge, must soon lose sight of each
other.</p>

<p>The most direct course for the pursuers was to
ride into the water and follow the fugitives, but the
lieutenant hesitated.</p>

<p>“They expect us to do it,” said he, consulting
with his companions, as was his custom, at a perplexing
point.</p>

<p>“Then why not do it?” asked Budge Colgate.</p>

<p>“Because we can gain nothing and may lose a
great deal. I would give all I have, which isn’t
much, for a chance at them, but this is a case where
we must try their own tactics: we must hide our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
plan of campaign from them, if it can possibly be
done.”</p>

<p>“What method do you propose?”</p>

<p>“We’ll turn back and ride off, as if we had given
up a useless task, or have started after reinforcements.
The Apaches will vote us sensible men for
doing so. Then we must manage to get to the
other side without discovery, and with the help of
Mendez will try to track them to their hiding
place.”</p>

<p>A comparison of views showed a unanimous
agreement that this was the best course to follow.
Mendez, to whom the others looked with special
confidence, nodded his head several times and told
them nothing else would do. They would probably
have to wait until night before setting out in
earnest, but that was far better than to swim the
river, when sure of being seen.</p>

<p>To emphasize his words, the dusky scout now
pointed across the stream and uttered the single
exclamation:</p>

<p>“See dere!”</p>

<p>All eyes followed the direction of the extended
finger and their hearts sank at what met their gaze.</p>

<p>“The very thing I have been dreading from the
start!” was the disappointed exclamation of Lieutenant
Decker.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">AN APACHE SIGNAL.</span></h2>

<p>When Mendez, the White Mountain Apache, who
was acting as guide for Lieutenant Decker and his
men, pointed across the Gila, it was not at the
fugitives, for they had disappeared from view
several minutes before, but at a point some distance
to the right of the route taken by Maroz and
Ceballos.</p>

<p>From a spot among the foothills of the Apache
range, that was several hundred feet higher than the
river, and where the rocks, boulders and pines
offered secure shelter, a wavy column of smoke was
ascending. It was so thin that, as it climbed slowly
upward, with the towering mountains beyond
serving as a background, it was perceptible only to
the keenest vision. It was fully dissipated before
reaching a point that would bring it in relief
against the clear sky, above the mountain crest.
More than likely that but for the searching scrutiny
of Mendez the others would not have discovered
it at all.</p>

<p>Beyond question the column of smoke was
intended as a signal for the hostiles who had crossed
the river but a short time previous. It proved that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
they had allies already among the mountains, and
that between them and themselves a perfect understanding
existed. No doubt could remain that the
outbreak was more serious than at first supposed,
and instead of having three or four renegades to
run down, there was likely to be double or triple
that number, with the prospect of another of those
long, exhausting campaigns under the sun of
Arizona, in which the innocent would suffer tenfold
more than the guilty.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker was so well convinced of the
serious task before him that he adopted a radical
change of plan. Even though he should succeed in
tracing the hostiles to their hiding place in the
mountains, his force was too small to strike them an
effective blow. He decided to return to camp and
report to the colonel, that no time might be lost in
organizing a movement that would bring the Indians
to terms, always provided the opportunity could be
secured for doing so.</p>

<p>This meant a long halt in the pursuit, which to the
father was unbearable. He could not remain idle
during the long, sultry hours, when his child was in
the possession of the band, who certainly meant
him no good. He must keep moving or he would
lose his self-control.</p>

<p>Declining, therefore, the invitation of the officer
to accompany them on their return to the post, and
thanking him for what he had already done, he
turned the head of his mustang toward home, and
struck an easy, swinging gait, while they rode westward
to Fort Reno.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>But Freeman had no purpose of returning to his
desolate wife and child until he could gather
decisive tidings of his boy, whether good or bad.
After reaching a point where the intervening undulations
of land were likely to shut him from the
sight of any watchful Apaches, he changed his
course, making it parallel with the river, spurred his
pony to greater speed, and finally returned to the
stream at a point more than a mile east of where he
had parted from the lieutenant and his little company.</p>

<p>He was familiar with that part of the country,
and without losing any time he rode into the water
and headed for the southern shore. The river was
narrower than below, but it was deep, and his
mustang was forced to swim most of the way; but
the bath was as welcome to him as to his rider.
Though both emerged dripping wet, it mattered
naught under the smiting rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Once across, Freeman felt that he had fairly
entered upon his important task. Disquieted as he
was by his grief, he was too old a campaigner to
lose his head, no matter how critical the emergency.
He had set out to locate the Apaches who
held his boy, and then, if no possible means of
rescuing him presented itself, he would give his
knowledge to friends who would be only too ready
to help him.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the difficulty of the
work thus laid out for himself. It brought him in
direct conflict with the subtlety of the worst of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
American tribes, and upon what may be called
their own ground. His chances of success were
hardly one in a hundred.</p>

<p>But, despite the discouraging outlook, the parent
was buoyed up by a fact, and by a theory which he
had persuaded himself to believe was also a fact.
During his two years in Southern Arizona he had
become familiar with much of the Apache Range, and
especially with that portion he now meant to visit.
He was quite confident that he knew where the
little company would make their first halt of any
duration; and instead, therefore, of attempting to
follow their trail, he proposed to make directly for
the rendezvous.</p>

<p>There was more than one advantage in adopting
this course, chief of which was that it involved far
less risk to himself. The fugitives would watch
their own trail and be prepared to ambuscade any
of their pursuers who tried to follow it, while, by
taking another route to the rendezvous, he was sure
to escape that peril. This, however, as will be seen,
hinged on the question whether or not he had made
a mistake in locating Maroz, Ceballos, and such of
their companions as they might have gathered
round them. That remained to be proved by actual
test.</p>

<p>The theory that did much to buoy up Freeman
was the rather fanciful one that the Apaches were
holding his child as a hostage for certain unlawful
deeds not yet committed. They had been offered
immunity for the crimes of the morning, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
scoffed at the offer. With the opportunity of
striking their enemies hard, they could not surrender
before doing so. They must give full vent
to their viciousness as preliminary to settling down
to become good Indians. When the time came,
and they were ready to yield, they would have the
advantage of giving the authorities the alternative
of accepting their submission, with the restoration
of the child unharmed, or of consenting to its death
by refusing their terms.</p>

<p>This was the theory, and as I have said, it was a
fanciful one, which Freeman did not mention to the
lieutenant, through fear that he would shake his
head and declare it could have no possible existence
in fact. He had managed to make himself believe
it, and it nerved his arm to the attempt that otherwise
would have been the height of folly.</p>

<p>The solitary pursuer had not penetrated far
among the foothills, when, as he anticipated, a
point was reached where his pony could be of no
further use to him. Accordingly he dismounted,
removed the saddle and bridle and turned him
loose, to wander at will, until he should come back
to claim him.</p>

<p>From the point where he left his animal to where
he believed the Apaches were gathered was hardly
a mile, but the distance was traversed with such extreme
care, that the long, hot afternoon was drawing
to a close before he was near his destination.
Well aware that the slightest mistake on his part
would be fatal, he determined to make none, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
patience, caution and circumspection could prevent
it.</p>

<p>That stealthy advance among the stunted vegetation,
over and around vast rocks, down declivities,
gullies and gorges, through hollows and ravines and
up abrupt slopes, was enough to try the endurance
and nerve of the bravest man. His vision was so
circumscribed that he often failed to see a dozen
feet in advance, and he never caught sight of a
boulder or rock, that he did not ask himself whether
one or more of his enemies was not kneeling
behind it, with leveled Winchester, awaiting just
such an opportunity to bring him down.</p>

<p>He could no longer detect anything of the signal
fire that was the means of bringing him thither,
and he believed it had been extinguished; but when
he was congratulating himself on his success, he was
startled to find that, without any thought on his
part, he had struck the trail of Maroz and Ceballos.
There were the hoofprints of their unshod ponies,
distinctly marked, where they had borne their
riders up the steep slope, and probably for a goodly
distance beyond, before they were discarded.</p>

<p>The path showed so plainly that it would have
been easy to follow it; but, instead of doing so, he
hastily crossed it and made his own course to the
supposed rendezvous more circuitous than before.</p>

<p>But if this discovery was alarming, it was not to
be compared to that which followed within the
next fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The settler had crossed another of those narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
gorges that were continually interposing, and was
guardedly picking his way up the opposite side when,
without the first warning, he observed an Apache
warrior less than fifty feet distant.</p>

<p>He was seated on the ground, with his back
against a dwarfed pine, his position such that his
side was turned toward the white man, whom he did
not see. This was the more remarkable, since, with
all the care the latter might use, he could not avoid
a slight noise in his movements which ought to
have reached the ears of an enemy at double the
distance.</p>

<p>Hardly repressing a gasp of amazement, Freeman
brought his Winchester to his shoulder, and
covered the warrior in the twinkling of an eye. No
matter how catlike the fellow might be in his
actions, he was now at a fatal disadvantage; the
white man had the drop on him.</p>

<p>Freeman, however, did not pull trigger. He
feared the consequences when the report should
ring through the solitude, for of necessity it must
reach the ears of others near at hand.</p>

<p>Still the Apache did not stir, even though the
settler purposely made a noise with one of his
feet.</p>

<p>“He is either asleep or is sunk in a deeper reverie
than I ever knew an Indian to be.”</p>

<p>Neither of these suppositions was satisfactory.
Freeman now coughed quite loudly, but with no
more effect upon the warrior than before. Then
the settler lowered his rifle, for he knew the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing around to make sure that no one was in
sight, Freeman walked forward, holding his gun
ready for instant use. The Apache’s head was
bowed on his breast as if asleep, but his continued
quiescence could be accounted for only in one way;
he was dead.</p>

<p>Such was the fact. The weapon in the grasp of
Maurice Freeman was the one that had brought him
low, but it was aimed and fired by the wife when
defending her home against the marauders. This
was the warrior whose body had been carried
among the foothills by his friends, until, believing it
was beyond danger of being found by the whites,
they had left it behind.</p>

<p>“Ah, if Molly had only used two more cartridges
with equal effect what a blessed thing it would have
been!” mused the settler, as he glanced at the
figure, “it would have saved Captain Murray and
his family, and it would have saved, too, my little
boy.”</p>

<p>This discovery was significant. The other Apaches
had been there at some time during the day, and
probably were still in the neighborhood. The spot
fixed upon by Freeman as the one likely to be the
rendezvous was not far off, and he felt more certain
than before that he was right in the belief that led
him to make this venture.</p>

<p>But with every rod’s advance the situation grew
more critical. No matter where the Apaches
might have grouped themselves, they were on the
alert for the pursuit that they knew would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
quickly made by the soldiers. Indeed, so vigilant
are these dusky miscreants that it may be said
there is only one brief period out of the whole
twenty-four hours when there is a possibility of
surprising them. That is a short time before daylight.
They are wide awake through the day and
most of the night, but if the most careful reconnoitering
shows them no sign of their enemies, they
are apt to succumb to drowsiness as daybreak
approaches.</p>

<p>By what has been said is not meant that an
Apache camp is unapproachable except at the period
named, but I know of no instance in which a large
band has been surprised by pursuing cavalry, except
in the dismal hours between three o’clock and the
morning.</p>

<p>Should Freeman succeed in locating Maroz and
Ceballos, and possibly several others, it might well
be asked in what way he would be better situated
than when on the northern shore of the river?
What could a single man hope to do against several
warriors who held his child captive?</p>

<p>Nothing in a direct way. But, having located
them, and learned that his boy was alive, he would
hasten to Lieutenant Decker and leave him to decide
upon the plan to follow.</p>

<p>Although but a comparatively slight distance
from the river, he was in one of the wildest portions
of the foothills of the Apache Mountains.
But for this the Indians would not have dared to
halt before penetrating further. As it was they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
felt as secure as if in the very heart of the range,
for nothing was to prevent them from withdrawing
still more whenever they chose.</p>

<p>Freeman had not gone far when the conviction
forced itself upon him that he was dangerously near
the Apache camp. True he had not seen nor heard
anything to show this, but it may be said “it was
in the air.” He felt no doubt of it.</p>

<p>The ground sloped in its irregular way at an
angle of almost forty-five degrees. The dwarf pine
was abundant, wherever its hardy roots could find
room to draw nourishment from the ground, which
had been baked under the sun’s rays; the rocks and
boulders were as numerous as ever, and, as Freeman
came to a halt and glanced around, he thought:</p>

<p>“They must have abandoned their ponies before
reaching this camp. A mountain goat could hardly
keep his footing.”</p>

<p>While the settler stood motionless, debating
whether to venture any further before darkness, he
was startled by a faint, tremulous whistle which
came from some point in advance. It was so soft
and musical that he would not have noticed it at
any other time.</p>

<p>“That’s an Apache,” was his thought; “and I
would give much to know what it means. He isn’t
far off either.”</p>

<p>If the call was a signal, it was likely to bring a
reply, but, though he listened intently, he heard
none.</p>

<p>“It might have been a bird; I would believe so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
if I were anywhere else, or this was another time,
but things are becoming too ticklish for comfort.”</p>

<p>He took several steps forward, not with the intention
of searching further for the camp, but to utilize
a gray, massive rock which bulged a dozen feet
above the ground. He would not be quite so conspicuous
under its shadow as when standing in the
more open space.</p>

<p>It was a proof of the power of the sun in that
latitude that, when Freeman placed his hand against
the mass of stone, he quickly drew it back, because
of the heat still in the rock. He had noticed the
same thing on his way thither when he came in
contact with other solid substances, but this was a
little more pronounced. However, it was a small
matter and he gave it no thought.</p>

<p>The slight additional sense of security was
quickly dissipated by again hearing the signal that
he had noticed a few minutes before. The trained
ear could not have detected any variation, and he
would have been certain that it issued from the
same dusky lips, but for the change in the direction
of the point whence it came.</p>

<p>At first it sounded exactly in front, as he faced
the mountains, but the second time it was well
round to his right. True, an Indian could have
readily shifted his position from one point to the
other during the interval, but Freeman believed
more than one was concerned in the business.</p>

<p>Whether or not such was the fact, the conclusion
was inevitable that he had placed himself in a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
perilous situation. The Apaches could outmaneuver
him, and, if they once suspected his presence, there
was no possibility of extricating himself.</p>

<p>His shuddering dread was that, despite the care
he had exercised, Maroz and Ceballos had already
learned the truth and were seeking at that moment
to shut off all chance of his eluding them. He believed
that those soft, birdlike calls referred to
<em>him</em>.</p>

<p>No one could question the bravery of Maurice
Freeman, but he would have given a good deal, just
then, could he have been whisked to any point, a
half mile distant, no matter in what direction.
He knew he had essayed a task beyond his power
and utter overthrow and disaster were near at hand.</p>

<p>While the Apaches might try to use the child as
a hostage, it was not to be expected that they
would attempt anything of that nature with the
parent. He would be served as was poor Captain
Murray, and his enemies would hold the same coign
of advantage as before.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it was self-evident that he must
lose no time in falling back and wait for darkness
before venturing nearer to the camp. Without any
delay, therefore, he assumed a crouching position
and turned to retrace the steps that he never should
have taken.</p>

<p>Before he had gone a rod, the signal again
sounded. This time it was directly behind him as
he had stood, when hiding behind the rock: in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
other words, he was advancing straight toward it.
One Apache, if not more, was in his path.</p>

<p>Freeman stopped short, and, without straightening
up, glanced searchingly ahead. As he did so,
he plainly saw the red man who had emitted the
signal step from behind another rock in full view
and but a few rods away.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">ON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE.</span></h2>

<p>Maurice Freeman was withdrawing from his
perilous position, when without the slightest warning
an Apache warrior stepped from behind a rock
a short way ahead and confronted him.</p>

<p>When it is stated that this individual held a Winchester
in his right hand and carried it at his thigh,
it will be conceded that his action was altogether
contrary to that of his people under such circumstances;
for it gave the white man a chance to bring
his weapon to his shoulder by a lightning-like
movement and to secure the “drop” on him—one
of the most difficult of all feats to perform. But
when it is added further, that the Apache belonged
to the White Mountain branch of the tribe his conduct
will be understood.</p>

<p>No sight could have been more welcome to Freeman,
whose face lit up with pleasure at the discovery
that, instead of an enemy, he had the best of
friends at his elbow. He paused a moment, and
then, with the whispered word, “<em>Mendez</em>,” on his
lips, moved toward him.</p>

<p>The dusky trailer did not speak, but raised his
left hand as an appeal for caution; and beckoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
him to advance, turned away and resumed his walk
with that catlike movement peculiar to his race and
which was absolutely without noise.</p>

<p>Freeman understood what he meant; the situation
was too dangerous for him to hold, and must be
changed without delay. He did his best to follow
instructions, though he could not do so with the
perfection of his guide. The latter continued the
lead for fully two hundred yards and then halted,
turned around and silently watched the white man’s
approach.</p>

<p>By this time the latter had lost the trepidation
he felt, when the soft, birdlike signal reached him
from different points of the compass. Wherever the
Apache camp might be, he was now at a safe distance
from it.</p>

<p>“I didn’t expect to meet you, Mendez,” said the
settler in a guarded undertone, “and I needn’t tell
you——”</p>

<p>“Be careful; the trees and rocks have ears.”</p>

<p>It was Lieutenant Decker who uttered these warning
words, as he stepped into view, very much as
the scout had done a short time before. He smilingly
extended his hand to his astonished friend,
adding by way of explanation:</p>

<p>“You didn’t expect either of us, but we are here
all the same; the fight which I looked for this
morning was unavoidably postponed, but I am hopeful
that I shan’t be disappointed after all.”</p>

<p>“Why, lieutenant, I am pleased beyond expression,
but you owe me an explanation of how this
was brought about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was all due to <em>him</em>,” replied the officer,
nodding his head toward the Apache, who did not
open his lips, but stood, looking back over the route
he had just traversed, as if watching for some expected
form, or listening for a signal that had not
yet been made.</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but that fact does not explain
matters.”</p>

<p>“Mendez is not addicted to talking, but I think I
learned more of his thoughts than any one else.
When you parted from us this forenoon, I supposed
you meant to go home and wait until night, before
making any move to help your child, but that
shrewd fellow read your intentions in your face and
in your manner. He told me you meant to ride away
from the river until out of our sight and then cross
and take up the trail of Maroz and Ceballos. I
would have followed you and protested against such
foolhardiness, but knew it was useless.”</p>

<p>“He hit the truth,” remarked Freeman, with an
admiring glance at their friend, whose attention
seemed still drawn away from them and who showed
no interest in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Instead of attempting to interfere with you, we
rode fast to the fort and reported to the colonel;
he had already learned the truth from the Indian
scouts whom he had sent across the river some
hours before. The indications were unmistakable
that eight or ten hostiles were on the war path,
and, unless prompt measures were taken, the number
would be increased. The colonel isn’t the man to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
hesitate at such times and he moved quickly. A
number of our best men at the post, with three
White Mountain Apaches, all well mounted and
under Captain Shindle, who was a veteran at this
business before I entered the Point, set out for the
mountains.”</p>

<p>“Where are they now?”</p>

<p>“All that I can say is that they are hard at it,
but I have no knowledge of their precise location.
The scouts who bore the tidings to the colonel were
certain the rendezvous was fully a mile back of
where we saw the signal smoke, and which was
meant to mislead us more than to guide their allies.
The captain will aim to get to the rear and to approach
from the south. This will give him a chance
to prevent the withdrawal of the bucks further into
the mountains. They will not look for a movement
of that kind, and unless their scouts have discovered
his purpose, he has a fair prospect of circumventing
them.”</p>

<p>“But where are Colgate, Peyser, and Redfield?”</p>

<p>“With the captain; this is a private campaign of
Mendez and myself, but we are willing to let you in
as a partner on the ground floor.”</p>

<p>“Nothing could suit me better, but, if the
Apaches are so far off, why this extreme caution,
and what chance is there of our doing anything to
help my child?”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit that the prospect isn’t dazzling, but,
if the theory on which Mendez is working proves
correct, we shall have an opportunity to effect something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is his theory?”</p>

<p>“That Maroz and Ceballos are not far from this
spot, while the main band is a mile beyond in the
mountains. They are watching the trail, along
which they expect the pursuit to be made, and will
telegraph the fact in their own way the moment it
is discovered to the main party. There may be
others with the couple, but that is the game they
are playing.”</p>

<p>“If Mendez is right, what have they done with
my boy?”</p>

<p>“He is with Maroz and Ceballos.”</p>

<p>“Would they not be likely to place him in charge
of the main band, so as to lessen the danger of his
rescue.”</p>

<p>“That would be <em>my</em> theory, but I suspect <em>he</em>
thinks differently.”</p>

<p>“I have as much faith as you in the woodcraft of
Mendez, but I can’t accept <em>that</em> theory.”</p>

<p>Freeman would have been only too glad to believe
as did the guide, but the doubt he uttered was
that which would have come to any clear-headed
man. If Maroz and Ceballos were acting as the
rear guard of the hostiles, they could not afford to
handicap themselves with the care of a prisoner,
the possession of whom, it may be said, was the key
to the situation.</p>

<p>If the boy were placed in charge of the stronger
party, the two would be untrammeled in the crisis
which they had every reason to believe was at hand.
This was the situation, as it presented itself to Freeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and Lieutenant Decker, but the latter’s convincing
remark was:</p>

<p>“It strikes me as mighty odd, but Mendez
wouldn’t believe what he does without the best of
reasons.”</p>

<p>“Have you questioned him?”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p>“He told me it was none of my business: not exactly
in those words,” added the smiling officer, “but his
refusal to enlighten me amounted to the same
thing.”</p>

<p>Freeman turned toward the subject of their conversation,
but he was so absorbed in watching a
point to his left, and listening for that which he
heard not, that the remarks seemed to be lost upon
him.</p>

<p>“Let me ask how near we are to the spot where
Mendez suspects Maroz and Ceballos to be.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant had put the same question to the
guide before coming upon the settler, and he
answered:</p>

<p>“Not more than a quarter of a mile.”</p>

<p>“A quarter of a mile!” repeated the astonished
Freeman, “why I was sure I was within a dozen
rods of it.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is easier than to be mistaken.”</p>

<p>It is singular how the emotion of mirth will
intrude at the most inopportune times. Maurice
Freeman was oppressed by a grief such as he had
never known before, but he now laughed silently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and heartily. He recalled his extreme trepidation,
when he believed he was near the Apache camp, his
effort to withdraw and the caution of Mendez in
guiding him away. To him the picture was that of
a big urchin, who has ignorantly approached some
danger, and whose father seeks to coax him back
to safety. The figure of himself playing the part
of booby was what caused him to laugh, but his
mirth quickly vanished, and he wondered at himself
for having shown it.</p>

<p>“If such care must be used when we are so far
from the camp, how will it be when we get within
sight of it?”</p>

<p>The lieutenant shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there isn’t much show for making
that test; I have been pleading with Mendez to
take me in as a full partner and to allow me to be
at his elbow when the first squint of the camp is
obtained, but my eloquence was wasted. The fact
is,” continued the young officer, becoming serious,
“he is right. I don’t believe the white man lives
who can steal up to an Apache camp in the day-time,
or during the early part of the evening, no
matter how dark, without discovery, and I needn’t
tell you what <em>that</em> means for you and me. After
midnight, when they are asleep, there might be a
show, but even then Mendez must be in the advance.
He expected to find you somewhere in this neighborhood,
and you have been as much an object of
search for the last hour or two as the hostiles themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“What was his purpose in signaling from different
points, when he located me?”</p>

<p>“I presume to give you a good scare.”</p>

<p>“Well, he succeeded! I was never so rattled in
all my life. But I was quite near the place where
I expected to find Maroz and Ceballos.”</p>

<p>“That may be, but you were away off in your
calculations; you made a mistake; I have done
something of the kind once or twice during my
checkered career.”</p>

<p>While the conversation continued in this vein,
generally serious, but now and then lightened by
the bubbling humor of the lieutenant, darkness
settled about them. This was most welcome, for it
brought nearer the hour for action. Between the
downsetting and uprising of the sun, the all-important
question must be settled as to what was to
be the fate of little Fulton Freeman.</p>

<p>The father and the lieutenant talked several
minutes longer, while their forms grew indistinct
in the gloom, until a remark of the officer caused
the other to turn his head toward Mendez. He had
vanished.</p>

<p>“What’s become of him?” whispered Freeman,
as if his absence indicated some new peril at hand.</p>

<p>“He’s gone to take a look at things; he moved
away fifteen minutes ago.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear him.”</p>

<p>“Nor did I, but I saw him, just as you have seen
the shadow of a cloud whisk over the earth. Of
course, there is no saying when he will be back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
since that depends on what he learns, but we can
count on his being here before daylight.”</p>

<p>“And in the meantime we have nothing to do
but to wait.”</p>

<p>“You hit it that time, and we can’t find more
comfortable quarters than these.”</p>

<p>It would not do to go far from the spot, since it
might cause Mendez trouble in finding them, beside
which there was no object in doing so, since one
part of the mountain differed little from another.
Accordingly, they assumed lolling postures on the
nearest rock, which was still warm from the rays
of the sun, and continued their conversation in
tones that could not have been heard more than a
dozen feet away.</p>

<p>Freeman had eaten nothing since morning, and
the thought of food had not been with him; but
when the lieutenant produced a small, substantial
lunch, which he was thoughtful enough to bring,
the two shared it and were refreshed therefrom.</p>

<p>“Now, if I had a drink of water,” said the elder,
“I would be satisfied; it seems to me I never felt
more thirsty, but I can manage to stand it until
morning.”</p>

<p>“There’s no need of that; a stream is within a
hundred feet of us. It doesn’t amount to much,
and is as warm as dishwater, but it is a thousand
per cent. better than thirst.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant located the spot for his friend,
proposing that they should go thither separately, in
order that one of them might be sure of being on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hand when Mendez returned. But the scout had
been absent so short a time that this precaution
seemed useless, and, when Freeman asked him to
show him the way, he complied willingly.</p>

<p>The night had a gibbous moon, and, as the sky
was without a cloud, considerable light reached the
earth, where the rays were not obstructed. The
vegetable growth in this portion of the Apache
range is sparse, the small trees being scattered, so
that it was easy to pick their way for the short
distance necessary to reach the water.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant had intimated, the draught was
uninviting to one not very thirsty. The rivulet
issued from under the roots of a tree, where it was
to be supposed it would be quite cool, but it was
lukewarm and roiled, as the officer learned when he
quenched his thirst during the afternoon, but the
drink was none the less refreshing on that account.</p>

<p>“Freeman,” said the lieutenant, looking around
them, as if suspecting the presence of an enemy in
their vicinity, “suppose you wait here for a few
minutes, while I go back to the old spot.”</p>

<p>“Why do you propose that?”</p>

<p>“I fancied just now I heard something suspicious.
Maybe I was mistaken, but when you are in this
confounded Apache country, the rule is to believe
every man guilty until proved innocent.”</p>

<p>“And if you were not mistaken?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the young officer in his off-hand
way, “it’s likely in that case that there will be music
in the air.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mean as to what <em>I</em> shall do. Am I to stand
here and take no part in the business? Is that
your idea of how one comrade should stand by
another?”</p>

<p>The question may seem trifling, but it perplexed
the lieutenant for the moment. The idea of comradeship
with him, as it is with every true soldier,
is that one shall stand by his friend to the death.
The basest crime that a soldier can commit is to
desert a comrade in extremity. Ordinarily, therefore,
the answer of Decker would have been prompt,
or rather there would have been no occasion for
asking the question, but while Freeman was a brave
man, his powers of keen, subtle reasoning, of cool-headedness
and quick resources were affected by
his mental distress over the peril and uncertainty
about his little boy. It is the rule among physicians
for no member of the profession to attend unaided
his own family (unless the peril make it unavoidable),
since affection must weaken the judgment.
The situation of the father was somewhat analogous.</p>

<p>In other words the thought of the lieutenant was
that it would be safer for them to be apart, if danger
should come. The elder not only could not aid the
younger, but would increase his own peril. He must,
therefore, stay where he was.</p>

<p>“I wish you would remain here until I signal for
you to join me. It may be that if there is anything
of the kind in the air, it will be best to let it alone,
and there is more chance of that with one of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
than with both. If I find myself in need of you I
will call.”</p>

<p>Freeman could make no objection to this, and he
sat down in the stunted undergrowth near the
spring, reflecting that with the fervid heat he was
likely to feel a renewal of thirst every fifteen minutes
or less, and was favorably located for quenching the
same without any trying delay.</p>

<p>“Listen for the signal,” whispered the lieutenant
again, “and don’t join me until you hear it. I
will make it as soon as I am convinced the way is
clear.”</p>

<p>The space between the spring and the rock where
they meant to await the return of Mendez was but
little more than a hundred yards. It was broken
by boulders, a number of depressions, with here and
there a dwarf pine, one of those sturdy trees which
seem to have the power of the moss to extract the
needed nourishment where most plants would die
for lack of it. Though the moon was almost overhead,
it was impossible for either of the men to
discern objects for a third of the distance which
separated them. The lieutenant had not taken
more than a dozen steps in his guarded manner,
with his body in a crouching posture and all his
senses alert, when the watchful Freeman was as
much alone as if the nearest man were miles distant.
The brave young officer was swallowed up in the
gloom and gone.</p>

<p>“Now,” thought the elder, finding himself alone,
“the Apaches must know about this spring; those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
people I suppose understand what hunger and thirst
are, though they have less trouble from it than any
persons I ever met, and it isn’t impossible that some
of them may take a notion to drink from the same
spring. That being the case, the prudent thing for
me to do is to imbibe freely while I have the
chance.”</p>

<p>Having drank deeply only a few minutes before,
Freeman felt as if he must make excuse to his conscience
for his dissipation, but the water was delicious
and the supply all-sufficient. He quaffed his
fill, and then replacing his hat stole softly from the
spot and assumed a crouching posture behind a convenient
boulder, where there was little likelihood of
an enemy stealing upon him unawares.</p>

<p>“The lieutenant is full of pluck,” he reflected,
“but the pluckiest man that ever lived sometimes
needs the help of a child. There isn’t anything he
wouldn’t do for me, and I will stand by him to the
last extremity.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Decker was alert and
guarded in every step he took. His principle that
while in the Apache country every indication of
possible danger, no matter how slight, should be
accepted as the reality, was the right principle. Its
disregard has brought death to many a brave soldier
on the frontier. Lieutenant Decker welcomed a
lively brush with the hostiles, but he would have
been the idiot which he was not, to disregard the
experience of those that had fought these fierce
people before he was born, while brief as was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
own experience, its lesson was too impressive to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>For perhaps a fourth of the distance he advanced
almost on his hands and knees, stealing from
boulder to boulder, at times almost flat on his face,
then raising his head, peering here and there, looking
and listening with the utmost keenness at his
command.</p>

<p>“There is no wind blowing though I heard a
rustle once or twice; I don’t think there has been
enough to move a leaf for the last half hour. Now
and then we meet wild animals in this part of the
world, but that slight noise—if there <em>was</em> a noise—wasn’t
made by any of them. It looks as if some
of the Apaches are hereabouts.”</p>

<p>Perhaps a veteran scout would have argued that,
inasmuch as the young officer had heard a noise—slight
though it was—the fact was against its having
been made by one of the dreaded red men, since
none of them would commit a blunder of that
nature, when in the neighborhood of an enemy,
but it might be they did not think any enemy was
near, so it was wise for the lieutenant to proceed on
the theory that some of Geronimo’s followers were
prowling in the vicinity.</p>

<p>For a period of ten minutes the young officer
held his place immovable. During that time the
oppressive silence was unbroken by the slightest
disturbance. Everything seemed absolutely “dead”
around him, the atmosphere itself being as pulseless
as the warm rocks and boulders on which he rested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his hand, as he glided near them. Certain that he
had not made the least betrayal, the lieutenant
began to ask himself whether he had not been mistaken
from the first in his suspicions.</p>

<p>With his head so near the ground, he lay flat, and
pressed his ear against the earth, as do hunters and
scouts when in the vicinity of enemies. At the
moment of resorting to this test, the ear told something
faintly, but it was gone at the moment he
composed himself to listen—a fact which made it
seem that the noise was caused by the first contact
of his own ear with the ground.</p>

<p>“Everything seems to be all right,” he reflected,
finally resuming his advance to the spot where he
and Freeman had settled down to await the return
of their dusky friend.</p>

<p>A rod further and Decker was checked by a rock
that must have weighed several tons. He could
pass it by turning to the right or left or climbing
over it. It need not be said that the last method
was to be used only as a final resort. He paused
once more and considered on which side it was best
to flank it—a question which it would seem could
not be settled by an hour’s deliberation, but there is
no accounting for the impressions which sometimes
sway persons in perilous emergencies. The lieutenant
was cautiously creeping to the left, and had
turned the corner, when he abruptly retreated and
headed to the right.</p>

<p>Advancing in this Apache-like style, he held the
Winchester which he carried with him in his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
hand, both hands and knees being used to aid his
progress, while he peered ahead in the gloom and
listened with the intensity he had shown from the
first. The configuration of the rock and the
position of the moon (not exactly in the zenith),
threw a line of shadow to the right of the immense
boulder just far enough to enfold his figure. On
the other side there was not a particle of shade, so
that his change of advance had brought that much
advantage to him.</p>

<p>From the corner of the rock around which he had
just crept, to the corresponding edge, was little
more than twelve feet, and half the distance was
passed, when the very peril against which he was
maneuvering presented itself. Beyond the further
corner appeared the head of an Apache warrior,
thrust forward, seemingly with the slow, noiseless
motion of the hand of a clock. He, too, was in a
crouching posture, for the impish face, with its
dangling mass of hair, was no more than a foot
above the ground. It was partly in moonlight and
partly in shadow, but shown so plainly that there
could be no possible mistake.</p>

<p>Although the position of the lieutenant was the
more favorable, the action of the hostile proved that
he was as quick to detect him as the other was to
observe his dusky foe. Before Decker could draw
his revolver or bring his rifle into play, the head of
the savage whisked from sight. It vanished so
suddenly indeed as to suggest the figurehead of a
wooden image that was snapped back by machinery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The situation was growing interesting. Here
were two deadly enemies within eight or ten feet of
each other, both equally alive to the fact, both
armed and ready to take instant advantage of any
turn that might offer.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Lieutenant Decker felt
comfortable. He knew the cunning of these terrible
red men, and would much rather fight them in the
open or on ground where the chances of each were
the same. This savage had been trained in the cunning
and woodcraft of his people, and knew things
which could not have come as yet to the white man.
But the latter was quick of perception and was
learning fast in the crucial school of experience.</p>

<p>In one sense, the two were on the same footing.
They were within striking distance, with the rock
between them, and he who was the first to discover
the other, even for an instant, must win in the
desperate game. It was, in fact, the question of
which could “get the drop” on the other.</p>

<p>The Apache might come around the corner of the
rock in front, or at the rear, or possibly he would
try to steal over the top, so as to fire down on his
enemy. If he could forestall the white man, by a
moment, it would inevitably be fatal to the latter.</p>

<p>There is a stratagem as old as the hills and one
with which doubtless every reader of these pages is
familiar. Lieutenant Decker gently removed his hat
and placed it on the muzzle of his rifle. Then
creeping slightly forward, he extended the weapon,
intending to make the hat show around the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the boulder. It will be understood that the idea
was to represent himself as peering beyond the
edge, so as to draw the shot of the Apache, and
then let fly at him before he could recover from the
blunder.</p>

<p>The young man had almost reached the corner
with the extended Winchester, when he withdrew
it and replaced the hat on his head.</p>

<p>“If there were a law against persons making
fools of themselves, I would violate it about every
hour of the day,” was his thought. “I’m glad no
one saw me.”</p>

<p>For, while reaching forward with one arm, he
awakened to the fact that even if the stratagem
was successful, it would not help him. Suppose
the Apache sent a bullet through the hat, how
could that aid the officer? The Indian would discover
his mistake before Decker could bring his
body to the same spot and fire—an act which would
place him in exactly the same peril that the hat
had encountered. Furthermore, more than likely
the warrior owned a repeating Winchester. If so,
the true course for him was to fire at the hat the
instant it showed and give the impression that he
had been tricked. That would encourage the white
man to rush to the attack and bring to his foe the
exact chance for which he was maneuvering and
waiting. Consequently, this time-honored and
once brilliant strategy would prove a boomerang
that would recoil with disastrous effect upon the
originator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The momentous question remained as to the
Apache’s method of attack, for, whatever it was, it
must be forestalled. The officer was obliged to
watch the front and the rear, and make sure that
his enemy did not glide over the top of the rock
like a rattlesnake, and strike down from above.</p>

<p>Decker leaned his rifle against the face of the
boulder and drew his revolver. The former weapon
was too awkward to be used in the impending encounter.
The smaller was equally effective and
tenfold more handy.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">A GAME OF HIDE AND SEEK.</span></h2>

<p>Lieutenant Decker pressed his ear against the
side of the rock and listened, hoping that his enemy
would betray himself by coming in contact with the
solid substance, but he was too cunning. He knew
better than to act in that amateurish fashion.</p>

<p>It was the result of guesswork, rather than of
reason, that the young man came to the belief that
the warrior would steal around three-fourths of the
boulder and come upon him from the rear. Accordingly
he faced that way, revolver in hand, and
ready for the emergency when it presented itself.</p>

<p>Reaching the corner, Decker paused, but with
the uncomfortable feeling that, after all, he had
committed a blunder and the Apache, divining his
reasoning, would make his next essay from the
front; but, since the whole business, for a time at
least, must be conducted upon conjecture, he grimly
held his ground.</p>

<p>During these critical moments, he did not forget
the peril from above. He continually held his ear
against the rock, believing that if the buck attempted
to steal upon him from that direction, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
must inevitably betray himself by sound, which
passes readily through a solid substance, and, hearing
nothing of the kind, he concluded the essay was
not yet made.</p>

<p>Now, nothing was clearer than that so long as
matters remained thus, the peril was not only unchanged
but impended as before. Who was to
make the first advance, as may be said, into the
enemy’s territory?</p>

<p>The lieutenant might have been more patient,
but for several contingencies which threatened to
complicate the situation. Freeman was still at the
spring; and although the understanding was that
he was to remain there until signaled to come, it
was probable that he would accept the long silence
of his companion as proof that everything was right,
and seek to rejoin him. Could he but know how
matters stood, he would give the very help needed,
but, not knowing it, was likely to run into a peril
which would prove fatal to himself before his young
friend could warn him or interfere in his behalf.</p>

<p>The other contingency was that the Apache
might have one companion or more in the vicinity
who would come to his assistance. Such a reinforcement
would decide the singular contest at
once and against the young man. The lesson of all
this was that matters must be forced to an issue
with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>The natural course of action for one in the
officer’s situation was to peer gradually round the
edge of the rock to ascertain where his enemy was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but no man, after second thought, would attempt
anything of that nature, for, it will be seen, that it
was only taking the place of the hat on the end of
the gun barrel. The watchful Apache was certain
to detect the insidious advance, and, before the eyes
came into view, would send a bullet through the
brain of the daring white man.</p>

<p>Accordingly Lieutenant Decker adopted the
opposite course. He darted his head forward, gaining
one glance along the end of the rock, and withdrawing
again, before the most alert enemy could
fire. It was the right course under the circumstances
and proved effectual.</p>

<p>The moonlight struck that portion of the boulder
with full effect, there being not even a ribbon of
shadow, and, in full view was the Apache, advancing
on hands and knees, his hideous face half-hidden
by the strands of black hair which dangled about
his shoulders and in front of his chest and features.</p>

<p>Could Decker have known this a moment before,
he would have discharged his revolver at the instant
of catching his glance, but to have known it was to
possess a knowledge that was impossible.</p>

<p>The puzzling question with him was whether the
warrior had seen him. He must be depending more
on his sense of hearing than on sight, and it would
seem that there was reason to believe he had not
caught that shadowy thrusting forward and withdrawal
of the head. If such were not the fact, he
must be unaware of the exact location of the white
man, who had only to repeat the maneuver, accompanying
it by an instant discharge of his revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>But, suppose he had observed the shadowy movement—ay,
there was the rub.</p>

<p>If he had failed to see it, he would continue his
advance, and continuing it, must disclose some part
of himself at the corner of the boulder. Accordingly,
the lieutenant partly straightened up, sitting
on his heels, weapon grasped, and eyes and ears
wide open.</p>

<p>But the minutes passed and nothing was developed.
It was impossible to decide what had been
done or what should be the next step. Since, however,
the former strategy had brought him knowledge
and no harm, Decker now repeated it, holding his
weapon, so that if the Apache were in his old position
he could reach him with a bullet.</p>

<p>It was like a man darting his head through a trap
door, and with one instant, all-embracing sweep of
his vision, dropping out of sight before any observer
could do more than recognize him.</p>

<p>The result was disappointing. The side of the
rock was bare. The buck had discovered his peril
and withdrawn. Where was he?</p>

<p>The lieutenant glanced behind him with a nervous
start, half expecting to see the miscreant in the
act of firing, but for the moment he was invisible,
though somewhere close at hand.</p>

<p>Since the Apache was too cautious to be caught
off his guard by this system of maneuvering, Lieutenant
Decker asked himself what other method
could be adopted. There must be a change in the
order of proceedings, or he himself would be discomfited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” he muttered, compressing his
lips.</p>

<p>No part of the rock was more than five feet in
height, so that if a man stood upright beside it, his
hat would show from any point. The stone was so
rough that it was as easy to climb as a flight of
stairs. The lieutenant’s decision was to adopt the
system of attack which he had held in so much
dread from the first.</p>

<p>Sensible of the necessity of instant action and the
great peril attending the recourse, he kept his
revolver in his right hand, as he grasped the upper
edge of the boulder, placed one foot upon an obstruction,
and silently raised his head above the
crest of the rock, intending to draw himself upon it.</p>

<p>His head and shoulders had just moved upward,
when with a grasp he let go and dropped out of
sight.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged!” he exclaimed, “was
there ever anything like it?”</p>

<p>Never did two enemies seem to follow so closely
the same line of thought. It looked as if the Apache
and the white man’s brains were working in unison.
Thus it came about that at the very moment Lieutenant
Decker raised himself over one side of the
rock to the top, the Apache did the same thing at a
point opposite. Both were climbing to the coign of
advantage at the same moment. Either could have
let fly with his pistol (for the Apache had one), but
instead of doing so he made all haste to drop down,
so as to interpose the boulder as an armor in front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Thus was another remarkable example given of a
unity of thought.</p>

<p>Everything thus far done by one was duplicated
by the other, and the two were once more crouching
behind the rock, each debating with himself how
best to end a situation, which, to say the least, was
extraordinary in more than one respect.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker now resorted to a daring proceeding
that was characteristic of the man. It has
been said that boulders were all around him. Less
than a rod to his right was another, perhaps half the
size of the one he had been about to climb. Hesitating
hardly a moment, he took several rapid steps,
crouching low, and whisked behind the new shelter.
Had the Apache suspected anything of the kind, he
would have possessed a fatal advantage, for what
better target can a man ask than a fleeing foe only
a few yards away? But he could not know it, unless
he happened to be peering around the rock at the
critical moment, and he was not doing anything of
that nature.</p>

<p>A creepy feeling came over the officer, during the
moment he was gliding across the open space, such
as a man feels who expects to hear the report of a
weapon and feel the sting of a bullet. He flung
himself behind the new shield with a feeling of inexpressible
relief.</p>

<p>“By George!” he exclaimed, as he looked
cautiously out; “I forgot my rifle!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, there it stood in plain sight, leaning
against the big boulder, within easy reach of his
enemy, should he attempt to seize it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“But he can’t do it without giving me a chance
to wing him,” muttered the officer, fully resolved to
avert the catastrophe.</p>

<p>The one comforting fact about the situation was
that the white man had improved matters and
gained an unquestionable advantage. The Apache
could not know of the change, and any attempt to
locate his foe, without knowing he had left the
immediate vicinity of the larger boulder, would expose
the warrior to the shot that was awaiting him.</p>

<p>The new position of Decker gave him a view not
only of the side where he had been crouching, but
of the upper end, just as a person can see two sides
of an oblong box from a certain point of view—a
fact which it was not to be supposed was known to
the warrior, who was, therefore, in danger of exposing
himself to a shot from an unexpected quarter.
Better still, he could not climb the rock without
also showing himself and offering the fairest kind of
a target.</p>

<p>All this tended to make the lieutenant much more
comfortable, though the feeling would have been
more marked could he have laid hand on the rifle.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be uneasy if sure he’s the only buck
near, but if a second appears, and my gun is left
there, they will have me foul—I’ll do it!”</p>

<p>All depended upon quickness and silence. In the
same crouching posture, he darted across the intervening
space, and was back again in a twinkling,
with his gun in hand. The success of his reckless
act thrilled him with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t been in this Apache country long,” he
reflected, “but I think I have learned something.
If that fellow gets the better of me, he’s smarter
than I believe.”</p>

<p>But it was unwisdom to count on safety when
peril impended. He was confronted by one of the
most fearful of enemies, a member of a tribe whose
exploits in cunning approach the marvelous. The
most fatal thing the officer could do was to underestimate
his enemy.</p>

<p>A dismal, disquieting question forced itself upon
him: if he had effected so radical a change of base
what was to prevent the Apache doing the same
thing? What warrant had the white man for believing
a scheme of that nature would present itself
to him and not to the dusky marauder? What was
to hinder his adopting the artifice?</p>

<p>The thought was like a wet blanket to Decker,
who instead of keeping “eyes to the front,” began
glancing to the right and left and behind him in
quest of an insidious approach from that direction.</p>

<p>Nothing was seen, but the element lacking to
make his situation intolerable came the next moment
with the unmistakable noise—faint, but loud enough
to him in his tense, nervous state to be heard plainly—made
by a body gliding over the ground. Hardly
had the conviction formed that it was his old enemy
stealing a march upon him, when he saw his mistake.
An immense rattlesnake, in its nocturnal wanderings,
had been disturbed by his intrusion, and
retreating a few feet, as if to gain a better point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
view, threw itself into coil, reared its head and gave
its warning rattle.</p>

<p>It was nigh enough to reach the startled man
with its venomous fangs, but before it could deliver
its blow, he leaped beyond reach and leveled his
revolver. There was sufficient moonlight and the
distance was so slight that he could have shattered
its head at the first fire, but, when about to press
the trigger, he restrained himself.</p>

<p>The shot would betray his presence to the Apache,
and not only put him on his guard, but give him
the chance to serve the white man as the serpent
had been treated.</p>

<p>“This is a lovely situation,” muttered the lieutenant;
“I like one about as well as the other, but I
don’t intend to let you have your own sweet way.”</p>

<p>The latter was addressed to the rattler, a bite
from which was fatal, but it could inflict no harm
except by a closer approach. If it attempted to
come nearer for the purpose of striking, the officer
would blow its head off. He kept his eye on it.
But the <i>crotalus</i> species is cowardly, and the serpent,
finding itself not likely to be attacked, came out
of its coil and glided off among the boulders and
was seen no more.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</span></h2>

<p>“Now,” said Lieutenant Decker, as the horrible
serpent glided from sight in the gloom, “if you’ll
pass round the end of that big rock over yonder
and give that Apache your attention, I’ll forgive
you for the way you scared me.”</p>

<p>As nearly as he could judge, the rattler was heading
in the direction named, and the officer listened,
hoping to hear favorable results, but the silence was
unbroken, and, if the reptile passed near the warrior,
there was no collision between them.</p>

<p>One of the uncomfortable facts connected with
these fearsome pests is that when you come upon
one in the desert or wilderness, you are likely to
meet another or perhaps several of them. The
species attain enormous size in New Mexico and
Arizona, and a sting from one of them, though
slower in its results than the bite of the cobra, is
about as fatal. No man can contemplate the probability
of coming upon a rattler unawares in the
night without a shudder. While it was not likely
that the reptile, seeing the crouching man, would
attack him, yet such things have occurred and the
lieutenant never allowed himself to forget the fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>His chief concern, however, was with the “two-legged
rattler” who, as matters stood, was tenfold
more dangerous than the creeping one. Neither of
the men had gained a shot at the other, but both
were hopeful of doing so.</p>

<p>“It must be that in some way he has learned of
my change of base. I can’t understand how he got
the knowledge, but if he thought I was still sneaking
along the side of that boulder he would not
content himself by waiting for me to come into
range——”</p>

<p>Fortunate was it for Lieutenant Decker that he
had made the change described, for, with the same
unity of thought that was marvelous, the Apache
had resorted to a similar artifice. Instead of confining
himself to the big boulder, he had stolen
back among the smaller ones, and wormed his way
forward and around until he secured a position some
twenty feet distant, which allowed him to scan
the two sides of the boulder that had been under
the eye of the white man for the last fifteen or
twenty minutes.</p>

<p>What prevented the perfect success of the Apache,
however, was the fact that he did not suspect his
stratagem had been anticipated. He expected to
find his enemy crouching along one of the sides of
the boulder, waiting for the buck to reveal himself
through some unguarded movement.</p>

<p>Failing to discover him at the first scrutiny, the
Apache silently rose to a half-standing posture, and,
with his head thrust forward, peered here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
in search of the man whom he was eager to shoot
on sight.</p>

<p>In this position his side was toward the officer,
who laid down his revolver and brought his Winchester
to the front, carefully sighting at the miscreant,
who was not only hungry for his life, but
had doubtless dyed his hands in the blood of many
an innocent person. No one could have been more
cautious than Lieutenant Decker, and yet, when he
came to adjust his aim, he made the exasperating
discovery that no Apache was in sight. He had
vanished like the shadow of a passing cloud. It
was hard to say what had caused his disappearance.
It may have been due to the slight noise made by
the white man in preparing to shoot, or his failure
to discern him where he thought he was, may have
told the startling truth with that lightning-like
quickness which marks the trained warrior, and
caused him to drop out of view and withdraw from
the post of danger with the same celerity that had
brought him to it.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, he was gone, and the problem
seemed to revert to its status at the beginning. The
two enemies were still maneuvering against each
other, with no apparent advantage to either. The
lieutenant, however, fancied he had a trifle the
better of it, for the Apache did not know where to
look for him, while he had a general knowledge of
the other’s location.</p>

<p>Now followed fifteen or twenty minutes of the
most trying nature. During the interval, the lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
neither saw nor heard anything that could
give him the slightest clue to the other’s whereabouts
or his line of procedure. When the ignorance
had continued that long, he began to suspect
the warrior had left the place. He might have become
convinced that it was too risky to attempt to
outwit the white man, or he may have suspected he
had a companion in the neighborhood, who was
likely to appear at any moment and turn the scales
against him.</p>

<p>This was a comforting theory, but the officer was
too wise to trust his safety to it. It would have
been in accord with the subtlety of the Apache to
contribute to the delusion. The strained situation,
however, could not last forever. Mendez was
expected to arrive ere long, and he would be certain
to bring a change. If the warrior was as shrewd
as he appeared to be, he would find that instead of
one man to contend against, he had two and possibly
more.</p>

<p>This reasoning became so convincing at the end
of fifteen minutes more that the lieutenant acted
upon it. Withdrawing still further from the big
boulder, he picked his way among the smaller ones
until near the spot where he had seen the Apache
rise to view and then drop out of sight again. He
certainly was gone, but might be not far off. The
lieutenant resumed his cautious circling of the huge
boulder until he had passed entirely around it and
come back to his starting point. This took considerable
time and was accomplished with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
utmost skill and care, but he neither saw nor heard
anything of his enemy.</p>

<p>“He has vamosed the ranch, of a certainty,” was
the gratifying conclusion of Decker, who felt a
greater degree of security than had been his since
the discovery of his peril. “At any rate, I’ll signal
to Freeman.”</p>

<p>And he emitted the low, vibratory whistle, like
the call of a nightbird. It could be heard but a
short distance away, though capable of being made
much louder and more penetrating.</p>

<p>“Freeman will be certain to hear it. He must
be wondering at my delay and won’t tarry in coming
to me. It may be that the Apache is listening for
something of the kind and will read its meaning.
If he does he is welcome.”</p>

<p>The officer compressed his lips and held himself
ready for any demonstration from the dusky miscreant,
who never would have given up his attempt
on his life unless compelled to do so by a fear of his
own safety. Glancing here, there and everywhere,
the officer was prepared to fire the instant the
opportunity presented, and was a trifle disappointed
that it did not appear.</p>

<p>He had gone through too many perils, brief as
was his service in the Southwest, to throw away
any opportunity by impatience or carelessness. He
repeated the signals several times, at intervals of a
few minutes, and watched and listened for the reply
from an enemy instead of his friend, but none
came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“The fellow has left, beyond a doubt,” was the
decision reached; “he has gone to join his companions
and nothing further is to be feared from him.
There’s no saying, however, what some of the
others may be doing.”</p>

<p>The distance to the spring was short. The
lieutenant showed the effects of the heat by lying
down on his face and taking another deep draught
of the tepid water, after which he donned his hat
and looked around in the gloom.</p>

<p>“Since the Apaches must know of this supply, I
shouldn’t be surprised, if some of them came here to
quench their thirst, which being so, I’ll locate a few
paces from it. What the mischief can be the matter
with Freeman?” he asked himself, with a feeling of
vague uneasiness; “I thought he would be quick to
respond to my call, but he hasn’t even answered it.”</p>

<p>It was well that Decker took the precaution of
withdrawing from the spring and ensconcing himself
among the surrounding boulders, where he could
peep forth, and, by the exercise of a little precaution,
see without being seen.</p>

<p>He had hardly taken this position when he caught
the sound of footsteps and the murmur of voices.
In the stillness he plainly heard the words spoken.
Their surly, guttural tones, the very few sentences
uttered, and the fact that he could not understand
a syllable, were proof that the new arrivals were
his old enemies, the Apaches. The carelessness displayed
by them was proof also that they had no
suspicion of the presence of any whites near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
When anything of the kind is apprehended, the
cunning and caution of those red men cannot
be surpassed. It is almost impossible to approach
them undetected, and they never indulge in the
carelessness shown in this instance.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the spring, they passed over
a spot where the moonlight struck them. There
were three, dressed and accoutered like the members
of the band that had wrought such sad havoc during
the past day or two.</p>

<p>They took turns in kneeling down and quaffing
from the spring, after which they rose to their feet,
and stood grouped together in plain sight of the
officer, who was stealthily watching them. One of
them appeared to hold his peace, while the others
exchanged views upon some matter that interested
all.</p>

<p>“The next thing I must do,” thought the listener,
“is to take lessons in the beautiful Apache language.
I may persuade Geronimo to give me instruction,
but, before he did that, he himself ought to have a
few lessons in other matters.”</p>

<p>Nothing would have been easier than to shoot
one, and perhaps all, from where the lieutenant was
hiding. The distance was short, and the wretches
deserved no mercy. Had Freeman been with him,
it is more than probable that the two would have
opened fire upon them with destructive results.</p>

<p>“If they’ll only be obliging enough to stand in
a row,” mused the officer, struggling against the
temptation, “I would let them have a broadside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
but the instant I dropped one the others would be
off.”</p>

<p>Prudence demanded that he should leave them
undisturbed. The sole purpose of this remarkable
expedition was to recover the lost child. To make
an attack on the group, without the certainty of
annihilating the whole three, would apprise the
Apaches of what was on foot and inevitably defeat
it. Besides, there was no telling what had become
of Freeman. He, too, was likely to become involved,
with disastrous consequences to himself.
The occasion was unquestionably one for the exercise
of self-control.</p>

<p>And Lieutenant Decker exercised it. He held
himself motionless, with his trusty Winchester in
his ready grasp, and with a strong yearning to try
his skill upon the miscreants who knew no such
quality as mercy.</p>

<p>The three warriors stood in plain view for fully
ten minutes. Then they walked deliberately away,
taking the opposite course from that leading to the
rock where the two white men had arranged to
await the return of Mendez with word of the stolen
child of Freeman.</p>

<p>The officer kept his position for several minutes
after the disappearance of the trio. There was no
probability of their coming back, after quenching
their thirst, but he meant to make sure they were
beyond hearing before he moved.</p>

<p>He was uneasy over the silence of Freeman, and
what he had just witnessed increased his misgivings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
If these warriors made this visit, it was not unlikely
that others had done the same before them. Coming
upon the white man suddenly, nothing was more
certain than a fatal collision, and yet it would seem
that if anything of the kind had occurred, there
must have been a shot, an outcry or some kind of
noise which assuredly would have been heard by
the lieutenant a short distance away.</p>

<p>But it might have been otherwise. They may
have been more guarded than the last, and, stealing
up to the spring, discovered the presence of the
white man. In that case, they could have crept forward
unawares and despatched him without any
disturbance that could have been heard twenty feet
away.</p>

<p>“I hope this suspense will soon be over. It
doesn’t seem to me that there’s much chance of
Freeman getting his little fellow back, even with
the aid of the matchless Mendez, and now it begins
to look as if it had gone ill with him. What a blow
to the wife and mother, and yet how many similar
ones have been struck in the Southwest!”</p>

<p>The lieutenant now resorted to signaling again,
listening with a painful throbbing of the heart for
the reply which came not.</p>

<p>“Something is wrong,” was his conclusion; “the
poor fellow may have grown impatient with waiting
and started off on a hunt of his own. If he has
attempted anything of that kind, it is the end of the
business so far as <em>he</em> is concerned. I should not
have left him alone—Sh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>At that instant he was thrilled by a peculiar
sound. It was not a signal or spoken word, but the
low, moaning outcry made by a person in the depth
of distress or great suffering.</p>

<p>“It’s Freeman,” whispered the lieutenant; “and
some grievous ill has befallen him! He is not far
off; what can it mean?”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">WHAT BEFELL MAURICE FREEMAN.</span></h2>

<p>It will not be denied that a most memorable experience
befell Lieutenant James Decker, and yet
what shall be said of that which came to Maurice
Freeman, whom he left beside the spring, while he
went forward to reconnoiter?</p>

<p>After taking his second deep draught of water, he
walked aside, as will be remembered, being impelled
thereto by the same distrust that led the young
officer some time later to hide himself while the
three Apaches came forward to quench their thirst.</p>

<p>“I understand his action,” reflected the father;
“he distrusts my judgment; he believes I am so upset
by my affliction that I would run blindly into
danger; but he is mistaken. Heaven knows that I
have suffered and am still tortured by anxiety
for my little boy, but I know better than to make
his peril greater by any recklessness on my part.</p>

<p>“I would be offended if it were any one except
Lieutenant Decker, but who can be offended with
him?” asked the captain, with a glow of admiring
gratitude; “he has risked his life for the sake of
little Fulton and will continue to risk it so long as a
shadow of hope remains. He is one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
chivalrous, noble-hearted young men I ever knew,
and if he lives will earn his star.”</p>

<p>When fifteen minutes passed without bringing the
expected signal from the lieutenant, Freeman
wondered whether anything was amiss. Had he
thought any danger threatened the young officer,
he would have hastened to his aid, without hearing
his call; but decided to await something more
definite.</p>

<p>With the same suddenness as his young friend, he
became aware that he was not alone. Some one
was near him and that some one must be an enemy.</p>

<p>The disturbance which brought this knowledge
was so exceedingly faint that at first the captain
could not decide what point it came from. He did
not dare move, therefore, through fear of a misstep;
but, grasping his Winchester, he looked and listened
with all the acuteness he possessed. The Apache
must have been the first to detect the presence of
another, for, with all of Freeman’s caution, he was
outwitted by the warrior, who appeared so suddenly
that he seemed to rise out of the very earth and to
be standing erect in front of the astonished captain
before he knew where to look for him.</p>

<p>But Freeman was a veteran soldier and was not
the man to surrender, so long as he was able to
strike a blow for himself. He recoiled a step, so as
to secure elbow room, and was in the act of raising
his rifle to his shoulder, when the Apache spoke:</p>

<p>“No fire—me friend.”</p>

<p>“Heaven! Mendez, where did you come from?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
asked the astounded white man, recognizing the
Apache, upon whom it may be said all their hopes
rested.</p>

<p>The warrior was standing in the edge of the
moonlight where his hard features were in so plain
view that Freeman wondered why he failed to
identify him the instant he presented himself.</p>

<p>“’Pache here—soon come,” explained Mendez;
“we go ’way, where don’t come.”</p>

<p>This precaution was so sensible that Freeman
willingly followed him a few steps further, to a spot
where they were not likely to be seen by any one
approaching the spring. When they halted it was
beside one of those boulders, so numerous in that
section that it may be said they were never out of
sight. The Apache kept his feet, as did his companion.</p>

<p>The heart of Maurice Freeman was throbbing
painfully, for instinctively he felt that this singular
visit had something to do with his child. He and
Lieutenant Decker supposed the friendly Apache
was at a considerable distance, intent on his task of
rescuing the little one, and now, much sooner than
was anticipated, he had come back, almost to his
starting point, and the boy was not with him.</p>

<p>“But he brings news—he brings news and my
heart tells me it is bad news,” thought the stricken
parent, striving manfully to quell all signs of his
great sorrow.</p>

<p>What intensified his anguish was the evident fact
that something was the matter with Mendez. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
walking in front of the captain, he made several
missteps. Once he stumbled, lurching far to one
side, and violently recovering himself. Then he
straightened up and moved with a firm step, as if
he had regained his self-control.</p>

<p>“He has managed in some way to get hold of his
favorite drink,” was the despairing thought of
Freeman; “he is a fine one to attempt to get my
boy out of the hands of a band of his countrymen!”</p>

<p>If anything was needed to confirm this belief it
was the manner of Mendez. It has been shown
that he was morose by nature, but now his tongue
was loosened in a way that Freeman had never
known before. He did not stop his walk until he
had gone more than a hundred yards from the
spring. Then he stopped abruptly, wheeled about
and said:</p>

<p>“Cap’n Freem’n brave man—heap big warrior!”</p>

<p>“No, Mendez, I am no braver than you, nor as
good a warrior in fighting your people, for I know
less of them than you; but tell me, do you bring
any news of my boy, who was stolen by some of
your people?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying, the Apache devoted a minute
or two to regaining mastery of himself. He managed
to fix his black eyes on the white man, with
something of his old defiant expression, when
meeting the gaze of an enemy. By the exercise of
his iron will, he succeeded in keeping his poise, but
he could not drive out the fumes of the horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
tiswin from his brain. They loosened his tongue
and gave an odd twist to his ideas.</p>

<p>“’Pache got boy,” said he; “Mendez see ’im.”</p>

<p>“I know that as well as you, for I too saw him
in their hands. Is that all the news you bring
me?”</p>

<p>“Mendez can’t git ’im.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Have they put him to death?”</p>

<p>The Apache shook his head, without speaking.</p>

<p>“I thought Mendez was a great warrior,” said
Freeman, hoping to taunt him into an effort that
he seemed reluctant or unable to make; “they
told me he could do anything; that he could get my
child for me; that he would earn the reward I will
give him——”</p>

<p>“Mendez want no reward—he take no money!”
interrupted the Apache, fiercely thumping his
breast.</p>

<p>“Then has he become a squaw? Is he no longer
the great warrior that he used to be? Has he
become old and weak?”</p>

<p>“Mendez not old—Mendez not weak! He great
warrior!”</p>

<p>Any reflection upon the courage or skill of the
friendly Apache roused his resentment, which was
the reason why Freeman pressed him.</p>

<p>“Where is your greatness? You come and tell
me that you cannot get my boy away from your
people, and yet it is not long ago that you set out
to do so. You did not say then you could not take
him from them, for you were the brave Mendez that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the white people praise and that is not afraid of any
one, whether he be white man or red man. Now
you are <em>afraid</em>.”</p>

<p>“Mendez not ’fraid! white man lie!” the warrior
thundered as he laid his hand on his knife.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of you, Mendez, but you have
been too good a friend of the white people for any
of them to wish to harm you. But I repeat your
own words. Shall I tell you what is the matter
with you?”</p>

<p>“No matter wi’ Mendez! He brave—he strong—he
fight.”</p>

<p>“There is much the matter with you; you have
been drinking tiswin; you are not yourself; but
for the tiswin you would be the true, brave, noble
Mendez.”</p>

<p>This charge being true, intensified the anger of
the Apache. He again placed his hand on his knife
and drew it partly forth. His scowling face, never
attractive at its best, was working with rage. He
seemed to be gathering himself to leap upon the
man who dared to speak these words to him. Believing
he was about to do so, Freeman quietly
braced himself for the struggle. He disliked to
come to violence with one that had done so much
for the settlers and the army, but the exasperation
of the captain can be understood. At the moment
when his hopes were at the highest, and when he
was certain that the scout was putting forth his best
efforts, he came staggering back to his friends
maudlin, helpless, worthless, good for nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The belief was strong with the parent that if this
opportunity was allowed to pass, it would not come
again. More than one peculiar circumstance favored
the cunning and ability of the scout, the combination
being of that nature that a repetition was not in the
natural order of things.</p>

<p>The weakness of Mendez for the vicious drink
was well known, and no person could be better aware
of its palsying effects than Mendez himself. It was
to be expected that he would indulge in it when
not on duty and the chance offered, but when
engaged on an enterprise in which his highest skill
was needed, there was no palliation for his dissipation.
He must have drunk deliberately, and the
father, distressed by fears for his child, could find
no excuse for him. His anger was natural.</p>

<p>But, if the Apache meditated an attack on the
white man, he changed his mind for the moment.
He drew his hand from his knife.</p>

<p>“Say Mendez weak?—say he squaw?” he
mumbled.</p>

<p>Freeman saw an appeal in these questions. It
was as if the fellow had become sensible of his condition
and craved indulgence rather than censure.</p>

<p>“The real Mendez is a brave warrior, but, if he
is afraid of the Apaches, he is not Mendez; if he
wishes to show to his white brother that he is still
brave let him go the Apaches and bring back the
boy they hold a prisoner; then Mendez will be cunning,
he will be brave, he will be a great warrior.”</p>

<p>The fellow straightened up with a majestic dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
that could not fail to command respect. He
had thrown off the spell of the horrible stuff, as a
Roman warrior might fling off his cloak to give his
limbs freer play.</p>

<p>“Mendez is brave: he is a great warrior; he is
greater than Geronimo or Cochise; he is not afraid
of them; he will bring back the child to his white
brother; let his white brother wait here and soon
his heart shall be made glad; he shall sing with joy
like the birds in the trees. Mendez will soon return;
let my brother have patience.”</p>

<p>Maurice Freeman was amazed. He had never
heard the surly fellow speak the English tongue
with such fluency and eloquence. It was a revelation.
He appeared to be another person. He
towered in height and was the picture of the great
Tecumseh himself, addressing an array of chieftains
and urging them to battle.</p>

<p>Before the white man could frame a suitable
reply, Mendez turned and strode off, his step that of
a conqueror. Captain Freeman gazed in silent
wonderment at the figure until it vanished in the
gloom and he was left alone.</p>

<p>The only explanation that Freeman could find for
this extraordinary occurrence was that when Mendez
came to him, though he was so under the influence
of tiswin, he was conscious of his unfitness for the
task he had undertaken. Prompted by a strange
self-accusation, proving that conscience burns in the
breast of every being, he had come to make confession.
Then he was so stung by the reproofs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the white man that he was roused out of his sodden
condition. He had really thrown off the effects of
the poison. In other words he was sober, and the
Mendez of old.</p>

<p>With his self-restoration came his natural courage
and confidence in his own prowess. He felt able to
do what he had planned, and set out to do it. He
would show Captain Freeman, not by words but by
acts, that he was the invincible Mendez, as the white
man had described him to the Apache himself.</p>

<p>All this was well, but it could not remove the
shuddering dread from the heart of the father that
the fatal blunder had already been made. The
Apache’s relapse had allowed the golden chance to
slip beyond repairing or recovery.</p>

<p>Freeman felt the need of Lieutenant Decker’s
presence and counsel, but he could not go to him,
for the signal agreed upon had not been sounded,
and besides, the instructions of Mendez were that
the father should wait where he was until his dusky
friend returned. He was obliged, therefore, to content
himself as best he might.</p>

<p>How long would he be gone? Would it be one
hour, two hours, until daylight, or, if he gave way
to his weakness again, would he ever return?</p>

<p>Had not the hostiles learned what he was trying
to do? Had they not plied him with the atrocious
stuff on purpose that he should make an exhibition
of himself?</p>

<p>These and similar questionings were rioting in the
brain of Maurice Freeman, when he perceived that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Mendez was with him again. He appeared with the
same strange suddenness as before, but alas! he was
alone.</p>

<p>“Where is my boy?” asked the agonized father.</p>

<p>“The heart of Mendez is heavy, for he brings
evil tidings; the pappoose of his white brother is—dead.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE REALITY.</span></h2>

<p>As Mendez pronounced the dreadful words, the
father, overcome by his emotions, uttered a groan
and sank to the earth. As if pitying his grief, and
feeling that it was idle to say anything more, the
Apache turned slowly about and walked away,
leaving the white man alone with his grief.</p>

<p>And then some one touched Freeman on the
shoulder, shook him and he—awoke.</p>

<p>It was all a dream. He had sat down with his
back against the boulder to await the signal from
Lieutenant Decker, and, hearing it not, had sunk
into a restless sleep, and now opened his eyes under
the vigorous stirring of his young friend.</p>

<p>“Come,” said the officer in a guarded voice, “a
sentinel must not sleep on his post. I heard you
moan and thought you had been hurt.”</p>

<p>It is impossible to throw off on the instant the
effects of a vivid dream. It will linger for a time
in our thoughts, even though strong sense tells us
the whole thing is absurd. Captain Freeman
during his days of campaigning had learned to fall
asleep and to awaken quickly. He saw almost on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the instant the true situation and greeted his friend
cordially and cautiously.</p>

<p>“This was a piece of thoughtlessness on my part;
but, lieutenant, I have gone through a frightful
dream: it makes me shudder even now.”</p>

<p>“I thought something of the kind was under
way, for I was guided to this spot by a moan that
was like that of a dying person. It was only a
little while ago that three Apaches came down to
the spring or rivulet, as you may call it, to drink.
They stood for some minutes talking. Had you
groaned in your sleep or breathed heavily, your
slumber would have turned to that which knows no
waking.”</p>

<p>“I have been fortunate, but perhaps it is well
that I slept, and yet I am sorry, for its remembrance
is terrible.”</p>

<p>“You have no faith in dreams, captain, I am
sure?”</p>

<p>“None the less they impress us, no matter how
we ridicule them.”</p>

<p>“But come! that must have been a lively one;
let me hear about it.”</p>

<p>Seated under the shadow of the huge boulder,
where they knew no danger threatened, the two
talked freely, though each took care that their
voices did not penetrate far from the spot. Freeman
gave the particulars of his dream, and it was plain
that despite his rugged nature it had made a deep
impression on him.</p>

<p>“Lieutenant, do you suppose there is anything in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
it?” he asked at the conclusion of the singular story.
The young man respected the sorrow of the elder
too sincerely to make light of what he said, though
he himself felt not the slightest faith in the warnings
and visions which it is claimed sometimes come
to people in slumber.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all; your feelings have been so
wrought up with anxiety that it would be still
stranger if you had not dreamed of your boy.
How could it be otherwise when there is nothing
else in your thoughts?”</p>

<p>“But it was so realistic that it clings by me.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of course; your brain was surcharged
and overflowed with the same string of
ideas, and did not cease its throbbings when the rest
of the body was asleep. They say we never dream
of anything which has not previously been in our
thoughts, but that is an error, for I know I have
had fancies in sleep which had never been in my
head during waking hours.”</p>

<p>“I have always held the same views as you, and
yet we cannot deny, lieutenant, that there have
been many verifications of dreams. To dispute it
would be to make out some of the best of men and
women to be falsifiers.”</p>

<p>“In their cases, I think, a good deal was due
to imagination, but you are not of that build. A
physician would explain your ugly dream on the
plainest of physiological principles, so literally
there’s nothing in it.”</p>

<p>“You know how fond Mendez is of tiswin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“That feature alone proves the character of your
vision. The fellow shares with his people the
weakness for that extract of hades, but when he is
engaged on business like this you could not induce
him to swallow a drop, if you held it under his
nose. That phase of your dream, therefore, condemns
it all.”</p>

<p>“I am relieved to hear you say so,” remarked
Freeman with a sigh; “you know more about him
than I do, and could hardly mistake on that point.”</p>

<p>“Rather curiously it is only a few days ago that
some of us were talking about that very peculiarity.
One of the men who had scouted for months with
him and Cemuri said that both had a certain conscientiousness
or rather devotion to duty which kept
them strictly sober, till their work is done. Then,
too,” added the lieutenant, as if resolved to leave no
foundation for Freeman’s fears, “there is no way by
which Mendez could have got the vile stuff, had he
been so disposed.”</p>

<p>“Could he not have gone among the Apaches and
drunk with them?”</p>

<p>“He, a White Mountain Apache, whose work for
us is well known, venture among the hostiles, when
they are on the war path!” exclaimed Decker, turning
with astonishment to his companion; “why do
not you and I go among them? It would be less
sensible for him, since they hate him more than
both of us together.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Freeman, “your words have given
me comfort. I have never had any experience in
the dreams which serve as warnings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides,” added the lieutenant, as the new
thought struck him, “my recollection of the old
superstition is that dreams go by contraries, so that
on that basis your omen is a good one. Let me
see—the theory was that every dream was to be
translated by the rule of contraries, unless it came
to us of a Friday night. Since this is Thursday
evening that lets you out.”</p>

<p>“Enough,” said Freeman, now able to rally from
his depression; “I care nothing for the dream, and
can look at it through your eyes. You have not
told me whether you saw or heard anything out of
the usual, though there must have been something
of the sort, or you forgot to give that call for me to
join you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the lieutenant lightly, “I had a
little entertainment of my own, and at one time it
looked as if matters would become lively.”</p>

<p>Thereupon he gave the incidents which have
already been told the reader, and which drove the
last remnants of the dream from Freeman’s
thoughts.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the captain, “that what
you tell me gives good cause for uneasiness.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“You have met four of the Apaches at least, or
rather you saw them. We thought none of them
were near. We must be close to the main party.”</p>

<p>“That does not follow; the one with whom I
played hide and seek was a sort of wanderer. He
had drifted into this section, and, not liking the
look of things, has gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“But he learned that you were here—you a white
man, and would not be likely to believe you were
alone.”</p>

<p>“I do not see why he should not think so, since
he himself was alone. He has known of the water
here and concluded that I had come from somewhere
to get a drink and was on my return, when
we came near running against each other. Remember
that we did not meet at the rock where we
agreed to await the return of Mendez, so he can
know nothing of that.”</p>

<p>“But, if he carries the news to camp, will not the
Apaches suspect the truth, or perhaps more than the
truth? They will think a party of white men are
after my child and become doubly cautious.”</p>

<p>“While it is possible you may be right, I place
less importance on the incident than you.”</p>

<p>“And the three whom you saw at the spring?”</p>

<p>“Their course proved they had not the slightest
suspicion of anything of that nature. Had they
believed any of us were near, they would have come
and gone without detection, or they would have
done worse.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope it is as you say; I am in that
nervous state that I cannot look at matters with the
coolness you do.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get the idea that I consider it fair sailing
before us. Mendez has a hard job in hand, and,
were any one else concerned, I would have little
hope; but he understands what he is doing and is
following some carefully laid plan of his own. At
any rate we shall know before morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The consciousness that the crisis was so near
added to the uneasiness of Freeman. He rose to
his feet and looked anxiously around in the gloom;
but they were so far removed from the little rivulet
or spring of water that a dozen men might have
come and gone without being seen, had they but
exercised ordinary caution.</p>

<p>“Since there is no telling when Mendez may
return,” suggested Freeman, “is it not best that we
should return to the other rock?”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Decker saw no objection to this course,
and he, too, rose to his feet. He stood a moment,
debating some question with himself.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he finally said, “whether any more
of them can be in the neighborhood. I am inclined
to take another look at the spring. If you will
remain here, I will promise not to keep you waiting
more than a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Very well; there’s no fear of my falling asleep
again, and if you are absent too long I will go forward
and find out the cause.”</p>

<p>“Wait for the signal, or better, I will return to
you.”</p>

<p>“It is the same distrust,” reflected Freeman,
when he was once more left alone; “but in this
business I suppose one man is better than two.”</p>

<p>Despite the reassuring words of the lieutenant, he
was somewhat troubled by the new phase of the
situation. Of the four Apaches whom he had seen,
one received a sharp reminder of the presence of a
white man in the neighborhood. If he carried the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
news to the camp of his people, they would see the
probable meaning of it, since no white person would
come thither for a drink of water, unless he left
companions in the vicinity. The fact that he was
near the spring would indicate that others were not
far off, and that the solitary Apache held such belief
was almost proved by his withdrawal in the
face of danger. A warrior with his acumen and
skill, who had come so near outwitting his antagonist,
would not be apt to give up the game of hide
and seek, unless he expected a change of conditions
through the arrival of other white men. He must
have felt himself the equal of a single foe, but had
no wish to become involved with several. His
course was simply a retreat before an enemy whom
he expected to be joined by reinforcements.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he might be operating on his
own responsibility, or, if a scout, would not rejoin
the main party until he could take more definite information
to them.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the young officer was in a
maze of doubt and speculation. Like the detective
trying to trace a crime, he could spin theories without
limit, only perhaps to find them all wrong in
the end. The situation which confronted them was
that they were to wait at the rock some distance off
until the coming of Mendez, and when he came, he
would bring good or evil news. That was the situation
in a nutshell.</p>

<p>Had the lieutenant discovered more Apaches near
the spring, he would have seen cause for misgiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and alarm. He, therefore, reconnoitered the spot
with the utmost care, listening and peering here
and there with the patient caution of an Apache
himself. It required but a brief while, however, to
satisfy himself that none of his enemies were prowling
in the neighborhood. Some of them might
have come and gone, while he was holding converse
with Freeman, but it was unlikely.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, therefore, did not hesitate to emit
the guarded whistle which quickly brought his
friend to his side.</p>

<p>“I have discovered nothing amiss,” he explained;
“I don’t believe any of them have been here since
the three I told you about.”</p>

<p>“I presume you wish to take the lead as usual?”</p>

<p>“It makes no difference,” replied Decker, who,
however, took care to place himself in advance, with
the other only two or three yards behind him. The
route had become familiar to both and neither
needed to warn the other to be careful. They advanced
in the crouching posture to which they had
become accustomed, with heads thrown forward,
stepping softly, looking keenly on all sides and
listening for the first indication of danger, which
might come from the rear as well as from the
front.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant found himself facing the
huge boulder where he had encountered the Apache
some time before, he paused, raising his hand for
Freeman to do the same. It seemed as if his old
enemy must still be near, and the young man did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
not pass the dangerous point until he had called
into play all the skill of which he was master
and convinced himself that nothing further was to
be feared. Then the two picked their way to the
rendezvous by the rock.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">A REMINISCENCE.</span></h2>

<p>Reaching the rock, the two men made another
reconnaissance before sitting down to await the
return of the White Mountain Apache. Nothing
was discovered to cause misgiving, and they were
almost convinced that they would remain undisturbed
until the coming of the scout upon whom all
their hopes were now placed.</p>

<p>The moon had passed further over in the heavens,
and its face was frequently screened by drifting
masses of clouds which rendered its light treacherous
and uncertain. They talked in low tones, not forgetting
to keep constant watch for the approach of
their enemies, some of whom it was certain were at
no great distance.</p>

<p>“That affair of mine with the rattlesnake,” said
the lieutenant, “recalled the singular adventure of
two scouts under Major Forsythe, in the autumn of
1868. The peace commissioners concluded treaties
the previous year with the Arapahoes, Cheyennes,
Kiowas, Comanches and Apaches. Other treaties
were formed, the object being to secure the removal
of the different tribes to the reservations selected
for them. There was delay and bad faith on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
part of our agents, and, in the face of the treaties,
many outrages were committed by the Indians in
Kansas and Colorado. Troops were kept on watch
along the lines of travel across the State of Kansas
into Colorado, and a company of scouts under Major
Forsythe, numbering fifty picked men, left Fort
Hayes, Kansas, in September. A week was spent
in scouting, when they reached Fort Wallace, where
Forsythe proceeded to refit his command. Then
news came that the Indians had attacked a train
near Sheridan, a small railway town, eighty miles
away. Forsythe set out with his force to punish
the marauders.</p>

<p>“The Indians were pressed so hard that they
resorted to their old trick of breaking up into
smaller parties, thus confusing their trail and rendering
effective pursuit impossible. Forsythe pushed
on to the Republican River, where he struck another
trail which grew broader and more distinct, until it
was clear that a large number of horses and cattle
had been recently driven over it.</p>

<p>“At the close of day, the command went into
camp on the Arickaree Fork of the Republican, at
a point were the river divides so as to inclose a low
sandy island about a hundred yards long. The
soldiers had but one day’s provisions, but their
intention was to push on and strike the Indians,
who were known to be not far off. At daylight,
while the men were saddling up, they were attacked
by fully a thousand Brulés, Sioux, Cheyennes and
‘Dog Soldiers.’ Forsythe retreated to the island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and the position was made as strong as possible. In
the first attack, Forsythe was badly wounded and
two of his men killed. A few minutes later a second
shot shattered the major’s left leg between the knee
and ankle. Almost at the same moment, the
surgeon was killed. Every horse was shot. That
fight and siege formed one of the most fearful
episodes in the history of our Indian wars. At the
end of the first day not a horse was alive, the provisions
were gone, the surgeon was dead, there were
no medical stores, four men were killed, four mortally
and four badly wounded, ten others being
slightly hurt, so that almost one-half of the command
had been struck.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, the Indians had been decisively
repulsed, the soldiers had plenty of ammunition,
water could be obtained by digging in the sand,
and the bodies of the horses and mules would ward
off starvation. But the men needed help in the
worst way. The nearest post from which this could
be obtained was Fort Wallace, one hundred and ten
miles distant. Two of the best scouts, Trudeau and
Jack Stillwell, volunteered to run the gauntlet.</p>

<p>“As soon as it was dark, they stole from the island.
There was little hope that they would succeed, but
both men were brave and cool-headed, and, if the
thing were possible, they were the ones to accomplish
it. The defenders waited long and listened,
and hearing nothing, believed they had been
captured. At dusk on the second day, during which
there was continuous fighting, two more scouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
were sent out, but they were discovered and barely
succeeded in getting back to the island. This convinced
all that Stillwell and Trudeau had failed, but
such was not the fact.</p>

<p>“Those two scouts, in leaving the island, moved
down stream, keeping as near the middle as they
could. The water was so shallow that neither
could swim, and they crawled on their hands and
knees for most of the distance. Lucky for the men,
the night was clouded, and the moon had set before
they left the island. They kept in the river for
three miles when they waded ashore, and, hiding
their trail as best they could, made for the nearest
timber. When day dawned, they were ten miles
from the river and their danger was greater than
ever. The Indians were patrolling the stream, on
the watch for just such attempts and the prairie
grass was so short that it was impossible for the
scouts to advance without exposing themselves.
The only way to escape capture was to conceal
themselves and wait for night.</p>

<p>“Sweeping the surrounding prairie, they observed
a spot where the grass was about a foot higher than
the rest. With the utmost care they crept to it and
found it just the place they wanted. The dead
body of some animal had acted as a fertilizer,
causing the grass to grow with more vigor and
density than elsewhere. The bones were those of a
buffalo whose flesh had disappeared long before.</p>

<p>“Lying down in this hiding place, the scouts
munched the slight meal they had brought with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
them, and then peeped out at their surroundings,
which were anything but reassuring. Indian
horsemen seemed to be moving on all sides, and the
sound of firing from up the river showed that fighting
had been renewed. Neither of the scouts
dared rise from a prone position, and were in constant
danger of discovery. If some of the sharp-eyed
redskins detected the trail leading from the
river, they were certain to follow it to the clump of
grass.</p>

<p>“Trudeau and Stillwell agreed to take turns in
sleeping and watching for every three hours.
Trudeau was the first to act as sentinel. He lay
upon his side, took a big chew of his army plug
tobacco, and peeped between the blades of grass,
while his companion slept. Before long Trudeau
saw a sight which was so alarming that he awoke
his companion. Twenty Indian horsemen were
approaching and were sure to pass very close to the
clump of grass, even if they did not ride through it.</p>

<p>“Stillwell peeped out and said:</p>

<p>“‘We’ve got to hug the ground close, but if they
see us, they’ll find out we come high.’ ‘You bet,’
replied Trudeau and the two grimly waited events.</p>

<p>“The Indians seemed to have no special business,
and rode so slowly that it was a long time before
they reached the point only a hundred yards away.
It was at this critical moment that a feeling of impending
danger caused Stillwell to turn his head.
As he did so, he saw an immense rattlesnake gliding
through the bones of the dead buffalo and coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
straight toward them. It looked as if the scouts
had invaded the reptile’s home, for he did that
which my pet did not do—he advanced upon them
with the intention of attack.</p>

<p>“The first thought of the men was to shoot or to
club him to death with the stocks of their rifles, but
any such act would have revealed their presence to
the Indians now close at hand. The next thought
was to stare the snake out of countenance as the
rattler himself sometimes does with his victims.
Stillwell made the attempt, but without any success.
The snake meant business.</p>

<p>“The rattler came straight forward until within
four feet of Trudeau, when he began coiling to
strike. Not a moment was to be lost, and Stillwell
made up his mind to shoot the reptile. He preferred
death at the hands of the redskins to that
from the bite of the rattler.</p>

<p>“For a minute or two, however, the jaws of
Trudeau had been vigorously working on the
tobacco in his mouth. He had accumulated a
volume of spittle, surcharged with nicotine. He
was nearer to the snake than his companion, and he
now shot out a thick yellow stream, as if from the
nozzle of a hose. It landed directly in the eyes and
mouth of the rattler, as he was almost in the act of
striking.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lieutenant Decker, with a smile,
“that particular serpent had never learned to chew,
and the pungent stuff in his eyes and mouth must
have disgusted him to fury. He had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
attacked with that sort of ammunition and it threw
him into a panic. He flung himself out of his coil a
good deal quicker than he entered it, and, turning
tail, glided through the grass and out of sight with
such celerity that the scouts, despite their dangerous
situation, shook with silent laughter.</p>

<p>“Their mirth did not last long, for the Indians
were so near that discovery seemed inevitable.
Lying as flat as they could, and wishing they had
the power to stamp themselves into the earth, the
scouts knew that a minute or two would decide
their fate. Capture by the Indians meant death by
torture, and they held their rifles tightly grasped,
resolved that if the worst came they would prove
the truth of Stillwell’s boast that they ‘came high.’</p>

<p>“The redskins, however, were not making for the
clump of grass. They rode past, the horses on a
walk and so close that their hoofbeats and the
mumble of their voices were plainly heard, but they
did not stop and that particular danger was over.</p>

<p>“Trudeau and Stillwell alternately watched and
slept until night came again. The rattler was
too sick of his reception to bother them further, and
not once did the Indians approach so near as in the
early forenoon. When the coast was clear, the two
stole out from their hiding place and resumed their
journey to Fort Wallace, walking rapidly and often
breaking into a trot. They were tough fellows who
could keep this up for hours, and, knowing the extremity
of their friends on the island, they did not
spare themselves. They reached Fort Wallace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
quickly made known the need of sending instant
help to Major Forsythe.</p>

<p>“Such an appeal is never made in vain, and Major
Bankhead was soon on the way with four troops of
cavalry. The Indians tried to jump his camp
twenty miles from the Arickaree, but failed, and,
without waiting to give battle, the whole band
retreated. Major Forsythe and what was left of
his command were saved.”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>“And it was your experience with the rattler a
little while ago that called this incident to mind?”
was the inquiring comment of Captain Freeman.</p>

<p>“Yes; I had not thought of it for a long time,
but when I leveled my revolver and was about to
pull trigger, the whole thing flashed upon me.
I saw the similarity of my situation with that of
Stillwell and Trudeau, though I was not in quite so
bad a fix, for the rattler did not mean to attack me,
if I let him alone, and there was but the single
Indian that was looking for me. But to fire my
pistol would undo what I had accomplished by my
change of base.”</p>

<p>“You had other charges in the weapon, to say
nothing of your Winchester, which was within
reach.”</p>

<p>“It was not that, but the dusky dog would have
known where I was and gained the advantage that
was mine.”</p>

<p>“It did you no good.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, it convinced him that I was up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to his tricks and caused him to withdraw without
any more attempts against me.”</p>

<p>During these minutes, the two maintained their
watchfulness. The words were spoken in low
tones, and, while the lieutenant was relating his
reminiscence, he continually glanced from side to
side. The fact that all remained tranquil confirmed
the two in their growing belief that nothing was to
be feared from the Apaches.</p>

<p>“It must be growing late,” finally remarked
Freeman, “and Mendez, it seems to me, is overdue.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant drew out his watch, but the moonlight
was not strong enough for him to discern the
figures.</p>

<p>“I’m bound to know the time,” he said, removing
his cap, so as to shade the light of the match which
he drew from the small rubber safe he always
carried and scraped it across the face of the rock.</p>

<p>“That’s risky business,” whispered his companion.</p>

<p>“That’s the reason I’m doing it,” replied the
officer, speaking more truthfully than he suspected.
“But it shan’t give much help to any of the fellows
lurking near.”</p>

<p>Before the twist of flame could assume shape a
puff of the breath extinguished it.</p>

<p>“It’s later than I suspected,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is near ten o’clock?”</p>

<p>“It’s a quarter to eleven.”</p>

<p>“It must be time to look for Mendez.”</p>

<p>“I think so, but there’s no certainty about it; he
may be here in five minutes and not for five hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
I suspect he will delay his return for a considerable
while.”</p>

<p>“For what cause?”</p>

<p>“You know there isn’t much chance of doing
anything against Maroz and Ceballos for a long
time yet, and there is no need, therefore, of his
coming here and waiting for hours. He would have
to lose sight of them for a good while, so that the
conditions are likely to change very materially
when he ventures on a move against them, whereas,
by keeping the two under his eye until it was time
to move, he could do so intelligently.”</p>

<p>“Furthermore, so long as he keeps beyond our
reach we can’t urge him to a haste that is against
his judgment.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless that has something to do with it, but—<em>st</em>!”</p>

<p>Both heard the same signal that had alarmed
Freeman during the afternoon, when he believed he
was inextricably caught. They listened for its
repetition, but the next few minutes were marked by
perfect stillness. Then, when they whispered their
speculations about its import, they disagreed as to
the point whence it came.</p>

<p>Freeman thought it was from the direction of the
rivulet, where they had quenched their thirst, but
the lieutenant was positive that it issued from a
spot at right angles to that course.</p>

<p>“We’ll find out when we hear it again, as we
shall do in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Do you think it is Mendez?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but it won’t do to bank on it until we get
further data; it’s the favorite signal of his to
announce his coming, but no doubt others of his
people use a similar call. If it is he he will come
right to this spot—ah, you are right!”</p>

<p>So it proved. The gentle whistle sounded again
and this time there could be no mistaking its
source; it was about half way between the rock and
the rivulet or spring.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget that it may be some one else; if so,
leave him to me,” said the officer, stealthily drawing
his revolver; “I’ve been disappointed so many
times to-day that I am entitled to this chance—there
he is!”</p>

<p>The outlines of an Apache warrior silently
assumed shape in the dim moonlight, and another
“disappointment” fell to the lot of Lieutenant
Decker, who returned his weapon to its place as he
recognized Mendez, when he uttered a single word
of greeting.</p>

<p>It takes a great deal to rouse the emotions of an
American Indian, but if ever there was an amazed
warrior it was this White Mountain Apache. He
had visited the camp of Maroz and Ceballos and the
discovery he made was one that fairly carried him
off his feet, and which, when related to Maurice
Freeman and Lieutenant Decker, held them dumfounded
with astonishment.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">A SURPRISE INDEED.</span></h2>

<p>Mendez, the White Mountain Apache and friend
of the whites, possessed mental gifts above most of
his race. More than once he had displayed a grasp
of details and a comprehension of plans rarely
shown by his people, and which were so unexpected
to the officers on the reservation that they were
filled with admiration. They trusted more to his
skill and perception than they did to any other of
the dusky scouts.</p>

<p>He had little to say, immediately after the outbreak
of Maroz and Ceballos, but those who knew
him were sure his active brain was at work, and
that, sooner or later, he would surprise them by
some exploit that proved an almost intuitive knowledge
of the schemes of the hostiles.</p>

<p>The part he acted during the day of the revolt of
Maroz and Ceballos has been told. Lieutenant
Decker, who was his constant companion, afterward
stated that from the moment he rode out from
Fort Reno with him and the three cavalrymen, he
did not utter twenty words, and those that fell
from his lips were mostly in answer to inquiries,
while the majority remained unanswered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be presumed that Mendez was satisfied
with the steps taken to head off Maroz and his confederates,
for, had it been otherwise, he would have
protested. But the effort failed, and then the fellow
found use for his tongue. He was freely consulted
by the colonel, and the steps that were taken to
subdue the outbreak were materially modified to
meet the views of the sagacious Mendez.</p>

<p>No member of the hostiles knew more about the
fastnesses of the Apache range than did he. He
read in the display of the signal smoke and the
actions of the band that had slain the family of
Captain Murray an attempt to mislead the whites
as to their true purpose. Instead of rendezvousing
at the advanced point, where from their actions it
would be supposed they had arranged to come
together, they fixed upon a wild, precipitous gorge
nearly two miles further in the mountains.</p>

<p>Locating there and keeping vigilant watch against
surprise the leaders would send out their runners
and bring in all the disaffected warriors that could
be persuaded to take the risk of another revolt
against the authorities. When they were fully assembled
they would burst from the mountains like
a cyclone and spread woe and death among the
ranches and settlements over an area of hundreds of
square miles.</p>

<p>To crush this rebellion in the bud was the work
of the soldiers, and enough has been told to show
that it was a task most difficult of accomplishment.
How could the brave boys in blue hope to surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the camp of the hostiles, when they were prepared
for such an attempt and were certain to take every
possible precaution against it?</p>

<p>Evidently there was but one way and even that
offered scant probability of success. By taking the
direct trail of the raiders and following it into the
mountains every rod of advance would become
known to the Apaches. They would form their
ambush, empty many a saddle and scatter the survivors
in dismay. It was for just such a campaign
that the hostiles planned and which they believed
was to be attempted against them.</p>

<p>It is not insisted that, but for Mendez, this course
would have been adopted. The intelligent officers
and soldiers of the Southwest learned fast, and
speedily became adepts in the subtlety of Apache
warfare. They learned how to ambuscade their
dusky foes as well as to avoid the traps set for
them, and the fight was often that of cunning
against cunning, rather than bravery against bravery.</p>

<p>The colonel, however, willingly based his course
of action on the belief of Mendez that the rendezvous
of the hostiles had been fixed at a certain
point among the foothills, which he described and
located so clearly that the other White Mountain
scouts recognized the spot, and were able to guide
the troops unerringly to it, by a route which would
allow them to use their horses for most of the
distance.</p>

<p>Fort Reno, standing on the western bank of the
Tonto, is fully twenty miles north of the Salt River,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
a principal tributary of the Gila. Instead of riding
eastward toward the Sierra Ancha, which would
have been the most direct route, the cavalry swept
down the valley of the smaller stream, crossed the
larger, and then headed eastward toward the
Apache range, passing to the south of Grape Vine
Spring, and fording Pinal Creek, which flows
directly northward into the Salt River.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the Indian scouts, this was
carried out with perfect success, the cavalry entering
the foothills from an unexpected point, and
stealing their way toward the Apache camp without
detection from the enemy.</p>

<p>But the ride was a tremendous one, covering as it
did a distance of more than fifty miles. It was not
begun until the afternoon was well along, and when
daylight dawned much was still before them. They
were forced to halt to rest their exhausted animals
and to prepare for the more delicate and dangerous
work before them.</p>

<p>Meantime Mendez and Lieutenant Decker were
doing their part well. Accompanied by a squad of
half a dozen cavalry, they crossed Salt River at a
point where they were certain of being seen by the
hostiles, riding here and there, apparently in a blind
search for the trail. They were ordered to keep
this up until night, and then recross at different
points, come together on the northern bank and return
to the fort.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the object of this diversion
was to deceive the hostiles as to the real plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of campaign. It was sought to make them believe
the pursuit and attack would come from the front,
whereas, the cavalry were at that very time making
all haste to reach the rear of their camp.</p>

<p>The members of the smaller party found their
way in due time to the fort, with the exception of
a couple—Mendez and Lieutenant Decker. They
stayed behind and pushed matters on their own
account.</p>

<p>Their purpose was altogether different from that
of Captain Shindle and the others, for they could
not hope to accomplish anything effective against
the hostiles: they were aiming to help Maurice
Freeman to recover his boy.</p>

<p>As the lieutenant had stated, Mendez knew and
told him that the father would do precisely what he
did do, and that, unless he was checked, he would
fall a victim to Apache ferocity, without affording
the slightest aid to his child. Freeman had made
the natural mistake of believing the hostiles would
rendezvous at a point much further in advance
than they did. Some of their scouts would be there,
on the watch for the approach of the whites, and
the chance of the father’s circumventing them was
as one in a million.</p>

<p>The lieutenant and the scout, having completed
all they could do in the way of diverting the suspicion
of the Apaches, now gave their whole energy
to the help of the stricken parent.</p>

<p>The whole question narrowed down to that of
the whereabouts of the captive, and whether it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
possible to secure possession of him unharmed.
Mendez suspected that Maroz and Ceballos, with
probably one or two companions, were at the
advanced position referred to, but whether they retained
the immediate custody of the child, or had
sent him further into the mountains with the main
band, or had put him to death, were questions
which could be answered only by personal investigation.</p>

<p>The natural conclusion was that the first proceeding
of the leaders in the outbreak would be to send
the child away from them, not only as a surer
means against his recapture, but to leave his abductors
untrammeled in their movements. Such, I say,
was the natural theory, but the sagacious Mendez
saw a reason for hoping that the reverse was the
case; in other words, that matters were just as it
was desired they should be.</p>

<p>Maroz was irrestrainable in his ferocity when
aroused. No crueler savage ever lived. He carried
off little Fulton Freeman, because he saw the chance
of torturing his parents’ hearts with deeper grief
by doing so than by driving a bullet through his
brain. He helped to shoot down the children of
Captain Murray, because their father and mother
fell during the opening of the scrimmage, and,
therefore, they could not be distressed further; but
he recognized the son of Freeman and saw his
opportunity.</p>

<p>To turn the little fellow over to the other
Apaches back in the mountains would be to relinquish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
for a time at least, control of his fate. There
were turbulent spirits with the main band who
were likely to insist on their own views as to what
should be done with him. It was not improbable
that these would conflict with the purposes of
Maroz and cause him keen disappointment.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that this was theorizing
matters down to a fine point, but it was the theory
upon which Mendez acted in his attempts to help
Maurice Freeman in his extremity.</p>

<p>The correctness of his belief in the first instance
was proven by his discovery of the white man
near where he expected him to be. Not intending
to be hampered by the movements of the anxious
parent, his first step was to pilot him to a safe
point, and leave him in the company of the lieutenant
until such time as their services should be
needed—a contingency that, as the Apache viewed
it, was so remote as to be almost out of sight.</p>

<p>Parting from them, as has been described elsewhere,
Mendez began one of the most difficult tasks
of his life: it was that of locating not only Maroz
and Ceballos, but the young captive. That had to be
done before the still harder work of rescuing the
little one should be attempted.</p>

<p>It is not worth while to follow the wonderful
scout, step by step, in his approach to the camp of
the hostiles. It may be described as the absolute
perfection of woodcraft—noiseless, unerring, and as
direct as that of the bloodhound on the trail of the
fugitive. As the gloom closed him in, and the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
eyes lost half their function, his advance showed
hardly any diminution, for he was never at a loss
as to the course to take.</p>

<p>But there came a time when he was within a
stone’s throw almost of the spot he had fixed upon
as the right one that his phantom-like progress was
checked. The slow, silent, gliding motion ceased
and the dusky scout stood motionless.</p>

<p>At that moment he was among the stunted pines,
where the moonlight was so faint that his keen
vision could penetrate only a short distance in any
direction, but the conviction was strong upon him
that some person was near. He had not seen or
heard anything to impart such knowledge, but that
peculiar sense known by the name of intuition was
as unmistakable as sight or hearing could have
been.</p>

<p>Sure enough, while gazing to the right, he outlined
the figure of an Apache warrior, standing as
quiet as himself, in a spot where the dim illumination
would have been secure protection
against any eyes except those of Mendez. The
figure remained stationary only a few seconds when
it vanished among the trees in the direction of the
camp of the hostiles.</p>

<p>As it moved off the friendly scout received a
shock, caused by observing a resemblance to one
whom he had known before, and who was the last
person in the world he expected to see. The
emotion, however, was transitory, and, waiting but
a minute or two, he resumed his stealthy approach
to the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>A few steps further and he caught the twinkle of
a fire among the trees, and he had only to put forth
the matchless caution he had displayed from the
first to gain sight of that which he was so desirous
of seeing.</p>

<p>There was a small fire of broken sticks kindled
against the face of a boulder, and in front of it was
an Apache warrior stretched on the ground in a
lazy attitude, smoking his pipe and seemingly half
asleep, as he gazed thoughtfully at the embers; but
Mendez needed no one to tell him that every sense
of the fellow was on the alert, and that the slightest
misstep on the part of the scout would bring
him to his feet like a flash.</p>

<p>It was Ceballos who lolled in this fashion, and he
was the only Indian in sight. His companion or
companions were absent, doubtless on the lookout
for the approach of the soldiers, who had been observed
hovering on the trail during the afternoon.
Mendez scanned every portion of his field of vision,
but Ceballos was alone.</p>

<p>That he had friends near, however, was proven
the next minute when a call, similar to that used by
the friendly scout, sounded among the trees. Instantly
the Apache came to a sitting posture, with
his head turned partly sideways, in the attitude of
intense attention.</p>

<p>Then he answered the signal in the same guarded
manner, and looked to the left, whence a second
figure emerged, with the noiselessness of a shadow.
As the firelight fell upon his face, Mendez recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Maroz, the fierce Apache, who had led the
revolt and whose hands were already stained with
crime.</p>

<p>He bent down by the fire, lit his pipe, coolly
seated himself beside his companion, and the two
began talking together.</p>

<p>It was all important that a part at least of their
words should be overheard, since they were sure to
help materially in gaining the knowledge which the
White Mountain Indian was seeking. Their voices
were low, but it was rather in obedience to custom
than through fear of any eavesdroppers. The stillness
was profound, and the listener was able to
catch enough of the words to hold the drift of conversation.</p>

<p>The result was a remarkable confirmation of his
own wisdom, for it proved that the couple had
placed themselves in this position, near the trail
leading into the mountains, to detect the approach
of the soldiers, and to give notice to the band, that
they might fully prepare to receive them. Maroz
and Ceballos speculated as to whether their pursuers
had formed any suspicion of the truth, and were
making their advance with such care that they
would not reach the spot until midnight or later.
Nothing, however, that was overheard showed that
they suspected the cavalry would try to steal to the
rear of their camp; they looked for them over the
direct route, as it may be called.</p>

<p>But the great question, after all, remained unanswered.
Where was the boy that these vagrants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
stole from the destroyed home of Captain Murray?
Inasmuch as he was not in sight, it was fair to presume
he was with the main band, further in the
mountains. Mendez suspected this was the fact,
but he was not prepared fully to believe it until
proof was given. It need not be said, therefore,
that he listened with the closest attention to the
words of the couple.</p>

<p>But the minutes passed without affording a hint
of the information he was after. Neither Maroz
nor Ceballos referred to the lad, but talked about
the soldiers, whom they were expecting, and who
they were anxious should come. The two took
turns in moving back over the trail, so as to prevent
any possible surprise, and their presence together
was intended for only a short time, and came about
because they were quite sure their pursuers would
wait until the night was further along.</p>

<p>All at once Mendez caught a reference to the
child, but the usually stolid fellow was roused to
the point of exasperation by the action of Maroz,
who, at the moment he made the remark, shifted
his position so as to turn his face directly away
from him. Ceballos imitated the movement in
order to accommodate him, so interfering with the
sounds of their voices that Mendez could not identify
a word, even though all were uttered in the same
tone as before.</p>

<p>No more trying situation can be imagined than
that of the scout, who, on the threshold of information,
found the door shut in his face. It was evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
that the couple were uttering the very sentences
he wished to hear, and it was equally evident
that he could not hear them so long as the relative
position of the parties remained the same.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting in the hope that they would
make another move that would favor him, Mendez
promptly took the only course that offered hope;
he moved round to the other side of the camp, so as
to place himself in front of his enemies.</p>

<p>This was a task of such extreme delicacy that he
stealthily withdrew until beyond sight of the little
blaze. With all his wonderful woodcraft he dared
not attempt the circuit while so near to camp, nor,
great as was his impatience, did he allow himself to
be unduly hurried.</p>

<p>But he was expeditious, and striking the right point
he again advanced, catching the glimmer of the fire
before he had gone a dozen steps in a straight
line.</p>

<p>It was a night of surprises, and the greatest of
his life now came to him.</p>

<p>Maroz and Ceballos held the same position as before
and were talking apparently about the captive,
concerning whom the spy was anxious to secure
information; but a third Indian was present.
He must have come during the few minutes the
scout was out of sight of camp. His coming was
as skillful as that of Mendez himself, for he had
heard and seen nothing of him. That singular intuition
which revealed the presence of another,
when invisible to the eye and inaudible to the ear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
was not always with Mendez, or he would have discovered
his approach.</p>

<p>The new arrival was standing erect, between the
couple on the ground and the fire, with his back
toward the latter. He was talking, and while holding
his rifle in one hand gesticulated with the other.
The same indefinable something in his appearance
and manner told Mendez that he was the warrior
whom he had seen a short time before.</p>

<p>But the face of the Apache was in shadow, and
for several minutes he could not identify him. At
the end of that time, however, he suddenly turned,
so that the firelight fell upon his countenance. And
then, as Mendez looked, he recognized him as
Cemuri, his companion of years, whom he was
certain was slain by Maroz within the preceding
twenty-four hours.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>It must not be supposed, from what has been
related about Mendez, the White Mountain scout,
that he was superior to the weaknesses peculiar to
his race. That he was brave, loyal to the whites,
cunning, full of resources and a consummate master
of woodcraft, was conceded by his bitterest
enemies; but while he possessed these admirable
traits, it must be stated that he shared the unfortunate
fondness of his people for intoxicants. At
times he indulged in this love for the frightful
decoction, “tiswin,” which, as has been made known
elsewhere, is the product of fermented corn, and is
one of the most villainous forms of “fire-water”
conceivable.</p>

<p>Had Mendez related the particulars of the outbreak
of Maroz and Ceballos, he would have stated
that he, Cemuri and they were indulging their
weakness and that, humiliating as the confession
must have been, he fell more under its influence
than any one of them. In fact, he was so far gone
that his recollection of the affray was always
exceedingly misty. He recalled that, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
explosion of a bombshell, the party suddenly became
engaged in a fierce conflict, in which he was
the principal offender, and in some way he was
slightly wounded and then left alone. The facts
that afterward came to light were of an interesting
character.</p>

<p>It is a physiological fact that intoxicants remove
the sense of moral restraint in a person, or, as it has
been expressed, a man, when under their influence,
will do that which he would do when sober if he
dared; in other words, while in that condition he
acts out his natural self.</p>

<p>This was the case with Maroz and Ceballos, who,
though less helpless than Mendez, became so reckless
that they threw off the mask they had been
wearing so long, and showed themselves the
ferocious miscreants they had always been. They
cast aside all restraint, and, being more sober than
Mendez, would have slain him but for the interference
of Cemuri, who had more self-command
than even they. He was able to refrain when he
had barely tasted the fiery stuff, and with a subtlety
like that of Mendez, when he was his own master,
he convinced Maroz and his companion that he was
with them in sentiment and would eagerly join in
the outbreak.</p>

<p>He professed to have a grievance against the
colonel at the fort, and was only awaiting the
chance to repay it. He would have preferred to
wait still longer, but since the couple were determined
upon taking the warpath without delay, he
was ready to risk everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>That he succeeded in convincing the two of his
earnestness was proof that he was as sagacious in
some respects as his comrade for many years. He
would not permit the latter, however, to receive
any serious injury, and thus it was that the courageous
fellow, who was literally helpless, was allowed
to wander off in the darkness, with little more
than a scratch, received from Maroz himself, who
had meant to destroy him without mercy. Cemuri
joined the rebels, displaying an ardor that surpassed,
if possible, their own, and so well counterfeited that
they were wholly deceived.</p>

<p>Mendez spent the night in sodden slumber, but
became himself on the morrow. Brushing the
cobwebs from his brain, and recalling the grotesque
incidents of the night before, he found himself
mystified to understand how it was he was alive and
substantially unharmed.</p>

<p>It was a part of Cemuri’s far-reaching scheme to
make it seem he was dead. By this means his
opportunities for befriending the whites were increased.
When, therefore, Mendez heard from
others that his former companion had been slain
and his body flung into the bush he doubted the
truth of the statement no more than he doubted
that Maroz and Ceballos were leading the formidable
revolt. He leaped upon his pony and dashed
to Fort Reno in all haste with the tidings. He was
considerably mixed as to details, but his story was
accepted with little questioning; and the measures
were set on foot that have been made clear elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Maroz and Ceballos had burned their
bridges behind them, they were not sufficiently recovered
from the effects of their debauch to undertake
offensive movements before the morrow.</p>

<p>Enough has been told to give an idea of the emotions
of the scout, when he recognized Cemuri in
the camp of the hostiles, and saw him in friendly
converse with them. Even his stolid nature was
too startled to permit him to form a satisfactory explanation,
until he had listened awhile to their conversation,
and had managed to recall a little more
clearly the events of the preceding evening. But
it was not long ere he grasped the whole plot of his
friend, whose peculiar mental qualities were better
known to him than to any one else.</p>

<p>The first natural question was as to why Cemuri,
if aiming to give the whites his individual aid, had
deferred action until this late hour. There must
have been many opportunities for striking an effective
blow before this. It may have been, however,
that he contemplated a grand <i lang="fr">coup d’etat</i> when matters
should approach a crisis.</p>

<p>These and similar thoughts passed through the
brain of Mendez, while standing too far back in the
gloom to be detected, watching the party and
listening to their conversation.</p>

<p>The words were disappointing to Mendez, for
they gave him no knowledge not possessed before.
They referred to the expected pursuit by the soldiers
and the plan for ambuscading them, whenever they
should penetrate far enough into the mountains to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
render the success of the Apaches beyond question.
He heard nothing about the stolen child, and was,
therefore, in as much ignorance of his fate or
whereabouts as before.</p>

<p>The one indispensable step remained for Mendez
to establish communication with his friend; that accomplished,
and the prospects would become the
brightest. But as matters stood, the task was
beyond the skill of the wonderful scout. The most
guarded signal that he could make was certain to be
heard by the hostiles, at the same instant it reached
Cemuri; and, instead of proving a help, must overthrow
everything.</p>

<p>His only possible hope was that the party would
break up by and by and leave Cemuri to himself.
If that should take place, the object could be readily
attained. The belief that something of the kind
would occur held Mendez like a statue, during
nearly all the long period he was absent from Lieutenant
Decker and Mr. Freeman. He showed the
patience of the Esquimau waiting by the air hole,
in the ice for the appearance of the nose of the
seal.</p>

<p>The experience of the scout was another illustration
of the truth that everything comes to him who
waits. After awhile Maroz stole away in the gloom,
leaving the couple alone. By and by he returned
and Ceballos took a hand. They reported that the
soldiers were not yet near, and were likely to push
their pursuit until the night was further along. All
this time not the first reference, so far as Mendez
could learn, was made to the little captive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, when the scout was looking for Cemuri to
start off on his reconnaissance, a fourth Apache
suddenly appeared in camp. He was from the main
body, further back in the mountains, and he remained
a half hour, discussing business with the
others, and making sure that no possible miscarriage
could occur in the plan laid for the overthrow of
their pursuers.</p>

<p>But the messenger finally left, and then Cemuri
set out to look after matters, disappearing in the
wood in the shadowy manner that his predecessors
had done.</p>

<p>The opportunity had come at last, and it need not
be told how Mendez improved it. He and his former
friend met within a hundred yards of the camp,
and that which has been told at the beginning of
this chapter was made clear to the scout, confirming
the suspicions he had formed while playing the
part of eavesdropper.</p>

<p>All the information the latter sought was speedily
given to him, and, parting from his companion
for a time, he made his way to his other friends and
told them the amazing story.</p>

<p>Maurice Freeman was so overcome that he was
forced to sit down until he could regain mastery of
himself. Even Lieutenant Decker lost his facetiousness
for the time, and stood with open mouth
and staring eyes, unable at first to ask the questions
that rapidly took form in his brain.</p>

<p>Mendez was a little foggy, as before, in describing
the occurrences of the preceding night, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
officer suspected the truth, which, if fully told,
would have humiliated the brave fellow. He forbore
to question him on the point, for it was of little
importance.</p>

<p>Cemuri was not present at this interview, but was
only a short way off, awaiting the return of his
companion. Telling his friends that the two would
soon be with them, Mendez withdrew, and they
were again left to themselves.</p>

<p>“It is the most wonderful thing I ever knew,” remarked
Mr. Freeman, in an awed tone; “in all my
calculations and surmises, I never deemed this
among the possibilities.”</p>

<p>“It would have been still more remarkable had
you done so,” replied the lieutenant; “it begins to
look as if you will recover your little boy.”</p>

<p>“I hardly dare believe it,” said the parent, with
a shiver of anxious hope, “and yet why not?”</p>

<p>“I think I understand the <i lang="fr">motif</i> of those fellows
in taking the extraordinary course they did. Maroz
and Ceballos, I needn’t tell you, are among the
worst Apaches that ever lived, and that is a tremendous
statement. They saw that if they allowed
the child to pass into the hands of the principal
band, they must surrender control of him. In the
complications likely to follow, it is not impossible
that the others would agree to give him up, in
order to save their own necks. That would be
wise, but at the same time it would rob Maroz
and Ceballos of their pet scheme of enjoyment.”</p>

<p>“It seems incredible that even an Apache should
be so cruel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is nothing which human ingenuity can
conceive that is too cruel for an Apache to do.
This being so, they did not handicap themselves by
keeping your child near them. They were liable to
lose him, in the event of a sudden attack, before
they could remove him, after the fashion that has
been popular among the aborigines, ever since the
Miss MacCrea episode, more than a hundred years
ago.”</p>

<p>“How readily they might have ended the difficulty
by putting him out of the way at once!” exclaimed
the parent with a shudder.</p>

<p>“But for their cruelty of disposition, they would
have done that. Such a course, however, must have
robbed them of the exquisite happiness they are
now feasting upon in imagination. So they carried
the sleeping fellow, as tenderly as you could have
done, to the place among the rocks, within a hundred
feet of their camp. There they secured him
against molestation from any prowling wild beast,
believing he would sleep until morning, though it
mattered little whether he did or not, since there is
no way by which he could help himself.”</p>

<p>“If I only knew the place,” added the parent,
half rising to his feet in his excitement, “I would
go thither at once.”</p>

<p>“That is the reason Mendez gave us no hint of
its location. I’m afraid, Freeman, he doesn’t rank
you as being among the champion scouts of the
country.”</p>

<p>“I never laid claim to that honor,” replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
man, with an earnestness that he would not have
shown under other circumstances, “but it is so hard
to wait—wait, when there’s no saying what obstacles
may arise.”</p>

<p>“You must content your soul with patience as
best you can, for Mendez is running this administration,
and no one can do it better.”</p>

<p>The suspense was briefer than the lieutenant anticipated,
though it seemed ten times its real length
to the distressed parent. A gentle rustling, evidently
made intentionally, caused both to turn their
head.</p>

<p>There stood Mendez and Cemuri, and the former
held in his dusky palm the dimpled hand of a little
boy.</p>

<p>“Oh papa, is that you? Why did you leave me so
long?”</p>

<p>“God be thanked!” was the fervent ejaculation
of the delighted father, as he seized his child in his
arms, pressed him to his breast and kissed him over
and over again.</p>

<p>Fulton was sleeping soundly when released from
his prison among the rocks, and Mendez started to
carry him, but the disturbance awoke the child, and,
seeing that he was feverish and frightened, his
rescuer allowed him to walk at his side as he wished,
while he led him to his father.</p>

<p>When a few minutes later the party was about
to start northward, in the direction of the river,
with the intention of picking up their ponies on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
way, and seeing Maurice Freeman safe home again
with his loved boy, Lieutenant Decker remarked:</p>

<p>“It seems to me we’re forgetting that we are not
yet out of the woods; are we not in danger, Mendez,
of being followed by Maroz and Ceballos?”</p>

<p>“<em>No!</em>”</p>

<p>While the little party were silently threading
their way northward to the desolate home which,
in due time, was illuminated with perfect joy by the
return of the child that had been mourned as dead,
Captain Shindle and his cavalry were pressing matters
from a different direction. The severe ride deferred
their assault on the Apache stronghold until
later than was desired, but the diversion, described
elsewhere, produced the best effects. Under the
guidance of the other White Mountain scouts, the
hostiles were so effectually entrapped that their
overthrow was complete.</p>

<p>In the conflict that followed, half of them were
destroyed by the cavalry, who knew it was mercy
to the innocent that such heroic measures should be
adopted. Those who were not exterminated were
captured and taken back as prisoners to the fort.</p>

<p>The disastrous results of the outbreak speedily
became known to all the hostiles on the reservation,
Maroz and Ceballos, the leaders, being among the
first victims to the vengeance they had invoked. The
lesson was of the most salutary nature. Others
were on the point of joining the hostiles, and, had
a temporary advantage come to the band in the
mountains, one of the most formidable outbreaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
known in the history of the southwestern frontier
would have followed, carrying in its train unutterable
woe and suffering.</p>

<p>But the prompt measures of the cavalry, and especially
the actions of Mendez and Cemuri, nipped
it in the bud.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
